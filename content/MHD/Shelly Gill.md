Are you interested in reducing anxiety or depression and improving coping while making connections to past experiences? Are you noticing patterns in your life that are not serving you? Would you like to improve your relationships? Therapy can be an important step for making meaningful and lasting change. I am skilled at creating a warm, nurturing, and therapeutic environment in which we will explore your strengths and challenges, discuss important issues from the past, and work towards meeting your goals. In this collaborative and safe space, I will support you on your journey to become the best version of yourself. <br>
I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor with over 20 years of experience providing therapeutic services to people of all ages, identities, and backgrounds. I am a patient, nonjudgmental, and empathic person, which is an essential part of my effectiveness as a therapist. <br>

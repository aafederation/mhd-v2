Hello, 你好! As a therapist deeply rooted in both Chinese and American cultures, I am dedicated to guiding you through a journey of self-discovery and emotional growth. My practice intertwines psychoanalysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and a strong emphasis on social justice, aiming to address your immediate concerns while exploring their deeper causes. Through active listening and an eclectic approach, I foster a learning experience that enhances self-awareness, emotional maturity, and connections. My goal is to help you cultivate curiosity, strengthen your relationships, and uphold your values and needs, while also offering solution-focused strategies for immediate challenges.

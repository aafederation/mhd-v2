I earned my dual B.S. in psychology and sociology from CUNY Hunter College and my M.A. in mental health counseling from CUNY Brooklyn College. I have over 5 years of experience in the mental health field with a wide range of levels including but not limited to depression, anxieties, LGBTQ+ related issues, intersectional identities, intergenerational trauma, and relational & interpersonal difficulties. I am trained in Psychodynamic and CBT Therapy.

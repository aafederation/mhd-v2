I believe that at their very core, human beings desire to live meaningful, connected lives. Using a cognitive, as well as existential and spiritual approach, I will help you engage your suffering in a fresh way so you can live a more present, contented existence. I am a mindfulness-based, existential psychotherapist located in Brooklyn, New York. My ideal client is someone who is interested in an alternative to Western psychology and has some interest or experience in Eastern thought or spirituality. Anyone who has found usefulness in psychedelics in the past could also be a good fit

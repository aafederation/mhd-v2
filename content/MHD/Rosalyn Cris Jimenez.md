Rosalyn Cris Jimenez is a licensed mental health counselor. She is a Filipina-American psychotherapist and certified meditation teacher. She enjoys working with folks of color who are curious about their feelings, want to actively dance instead of wrestle with their worries, need encouragement in expressing their needs, and want to balance the pain and joy related to cultural identity.

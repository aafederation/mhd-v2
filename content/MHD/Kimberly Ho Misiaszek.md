I help frustrated parents and adult survivors of trauma build a healthier family life. I work with kids 6+, teens, and adults. My adult clients are recovering from childhood sexual abuse or childhood neglect. My younger clients may experience: trouble concentrating, depression, anxiety, troubled sleeping/nightmares, social withdrawal or irritability, and anger outbursts. They may have experienced psychological, physical, or sexual abuse, school violence, immigration stress, or a discrete traumatic event like a car accident or natural disaster. <br>
Through psychological/psychoeducational assessment, I also specialize in lending a helping hand when something doesn't seem quite right with your child's learning, functioning, behavior, social skills and more. Through a tailored testing battery, I provide recommendations that you can provide to schools, therapists, and other professionals and assist in helping with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) or 504 plans. I have conducted evaluations for concerns such as ADHD, learning disorders, giftedness, and emotional/behavioral concerns. <br>
I am a licensed clinical psychologist (FL, CT & NY as well as all PSYPACT states) and received training at the Yale School of Medicine's Child Study Center, and the Yale Center for Traumatic Stress and Recovery. I use approaches like Cognitive Processing Therapy, TF-CBT, and CFTSI (Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention) to improve family functioning, help you feel unstuck, and more connected and peaceful. I am currently a faculty member at the University of Miami where I also received my doctoral degree in psychology. Prior to returning to Miami, FL I worked as a psychologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, MD. I also trained and worked in New York, NY having completed a Master's degree in Mental Health Counseling from New York University.

My name is Akane (they/them) and I am a Certified Reiki Practitioner and Personal Trainer. I was raised in the Deep South and currently reside in unceded Lenape land (Brooklyn, NY). I practice Personal Training and Reiki as methods tuning into our bodiesâ€™ innate capacities for healing, wisdom, and strength. My purpose is to help facilitate for clients a deepened, conscious, trustful connection with the infinitely wise body, whether it is through lifting weights or on the Reiki table.

I am a New York State licensed mental health counselor (LMHC) and a graduate of New York University's Masters of Arts in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness program. I provide individual and couples therapy to adults. My speciality is working with adults experiencing depression, anxiety, stress, relationship/marital concerns, low self-esteem, career/academic issues, life transitions/adjustment, identity issues and trauma/grief.

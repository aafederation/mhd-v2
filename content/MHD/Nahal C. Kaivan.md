I believe that it is essential for my practice as a psychologist to engage in research, teaching/training, and putting into practice the knowledge that I learn and create through therapy. My passion for this work is grounded in my connection to humanity, and my therapy style integrates interpersonal, ecological, family systems, and behavioral approaches in an effort to understand, embrace, and uplift multiple ways of being. <br>
I have practiced therapy and taught and researched identity in the United States, France, Spain, and Morocco. My international and cross-cultural experiences inspire me to grow and learn as a practicing psychologist, and I am especially interested in working with individuals occupying marginalized, silenced, and oppressed identities. <br>
I have experience working in community mental health with adolescents, individuals, couples, and families and I have worked in multiple roles within higher education, including in university counseling centers, as an advising and administrative dean, and as a professor. As an identity researcher, working across the lifespan with clients from diverse backgrounds demonstrates that so many of us yearn to explore our identities and existences. <br>
Prior to completing my Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology, I completed a Master’s Degree in Marital and Family Therapy. I was drawn to learning about families and systems as a way of identifying the patterns we learn and integrate into our adult relationships. In my Ph.D., I was encouraged to continue learning about multicultural psychology and to pursue identity research. I began learning terminology related to marginality, oppression, and social justice that resonated with my experience as a woman of color, a first-generation American, and other intersecting identities. <br>

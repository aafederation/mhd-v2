I am a licensed psychologist and registered yoga teacher who specializes in integrating mindfulness and body awareness with evidence based trauma focused therapies. I was previously a psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and an Instructor at Harvard Medical School. My current practice is influenced by the work I did in these roles. I offer expertise in trauma-related issues, including post-traumatic stress, anxiety, phobias, and sleep disturbance, as well as the interpersonal challenges that arise from these experiences.   
I primarily utilize a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach and draw from mindfulness and acceptance techniques. This means that we will work towards building non-judgmental awareness of your thoughts and emotions and a willingness to better tolerate them as opposed to controlling them. Our ultimate aim will be to help you learn to accept situations you are unable to change, and commit to changing those which you can.  
When we work together, I will help you to identify your values, and we will use these as the “big picture” to guide our work. My practice is both collaborative and compassionate, aiming to build skills that will empower you to identify and face fears and live the life you want.  
The work we do will be active. Sessions will involve learning and practicing skills to help identify your values and strengths, along with the patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that interfere with your moving forward. Between sessions, you will practice these strategies so that you are well-equipped to progress in this journey.

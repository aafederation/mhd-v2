My client-centered approach is rooted in Art Therapy and Evidence-Based modalities. I specialize in helping children and youth, ages 4-21, feel more confident and connected. My work is centered around the belief that young people are fully deserving of respect, dignity, and a space where they can deeply feel heard. I facilitate a safe environment where feelings and experiences can be validated, and children can establish a sense of security and self-worth. I partner with children (and parents) to help them navigate their identity and sense of belonging in this world!

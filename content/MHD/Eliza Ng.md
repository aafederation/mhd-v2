Hi, Iâ€™m Eliza, and in my therapeutic practice I aim to support your journey towards self-discovery and deeper self-compassion. I earned my Master of Social Work at the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College, and I have over a decade of experience working in community based non-profits with a focus on LGBTQ+ youth and adults experiencing homelessness. <br>
I care deeply about working within the LGBTQ+ community and with individuals in non-traditional relationships. I value anti-oppressive and social justice-oriented frameworks in my practice. With this as a foundation, along with extensive experience facilitating communication, inclusion, and leadership workshops in the workplace, I aim to support you in your work towards empowerment and purposeful well-being. <br>
Creating a space where you feel seen and safe is incredibly important to me. I utilize a client-centered approach, incorporating CBT, Motivational Interviewing, Somatic, and Psychodynamic work depending on your needs and goals. I view my role as a partner as you strive toward a more fulfilling and meaningful life. <br>

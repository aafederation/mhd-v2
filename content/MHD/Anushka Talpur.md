I am a dedicated and highly skilled therapist. With me, you'll find a warm, non-judgmental, and empathetic space to explore your challenges, uncover your strengths, and create a brighter future. I work with individuals and couples who are experiencing depression, anxiety, relationship issues, stress and  life transitions including parenthood, entering into a new job, new relationship. <br>
My therapeutic approach is client-centered, meaning that your unique needs and goals are at the forefront of every session. I believe that the therapeutic relationship is a crucial element of healing, and I strive to create a safe and trusting environment where you can explore and grow. Whether you're dealing with anxiety, depression, relationship issues, or simply seeking personal growth, we'll work together to develop strategies for positive change. <br>
I believe that understanding the unconscious processes and past experiences can shed light on current issues. In our sessions, we will delve into your inner world, exploring emotions, patterns, and relationships to promote self-awareness and personal growth. <br>
Building healthy connections with others is essential for overall well-being. I work with individuals and couples to improve communication, resolve conflicts, and foster deeper emotional connections in their relationships. <br>
For couples seeking to enhance their bond, I employ Gottman therapy principles, which are research-based and proven to strengthen relationships. We'll work together to identify and address relationship issues and goals. <br>

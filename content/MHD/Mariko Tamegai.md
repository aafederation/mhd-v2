Mariko is originally from Japan.  She has been living in NYC. Her intuitive, creative mind is open to make art and music.  Her mind is always open to start new things.  It was life changing to become a Reiki Practitioner after she had life tragic events on 2016.  Her spiritual journey never ends as she continues to study and practice.

Reiki has been healing myself and many others. I’ve noticed how I changed my mind set and have more flexibility for many things since I’ve practice Reiki.  Reiki energy healing is using intuitions, nature vibrations, the universe energy and love to tune your bodies energies.  Our mind and body energy could be unbalanced energy by life changing circumstance, emotional issue, grief, trauma etc..  Reiki is gentle energy healing for blanching energy inside and outside of body.  She use crystal bowls, tuning fork, synthesizers, and many  various instruments  to getting into more relax and trance state for sound bath.

She is offering individual sessions (in-person, remote), group sessions (sound bath, guided meditation, reiki sessions, grief healing sessions), and also teaching reiki level 1, level 2.  She is hosting community reiki (online) every Friday since 2020.  Also in-person every Friday.  She started to join (2018)and host (2023) hospital volunteer reiki though MahaRose community.  She has been hosting many various types of workshops.

Katherine Liaw is a Board Certified Licensed Creative Arts Therapist in New York. In 2016, she graduated from Hofstra University with a master’s degree in Creative Arts Therapy. She has experience working with various populations, including adolescents, adults, and the elderly. Katherine was trained in a client-centered approach, specifically motivational interviewing, while working at a homeless shelter. To encourage and empower her clients, she combines client-centered, insight-oriented, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques with art therapy.

Katherine felt called to work as an art therapist when she encountered women in a domestic violence shelter while doing volunteer work. She felt compelled to help others recover and find hope. Katherine desires to help young adult women who are facing past and current traumas, faith challenges, stress, anxiety, life transitions, or loss.

To engage in art therapy, you don’t need to be artistically gifted or skilled; all you need is a willingness to explore the creative process and work toward healing! Katherine believes that the creative process of art expression can foster self-awareness, self-esteem, emotional resiliency, and gain fresh perspectives and insights in ways that talk therapy alone cannot.

Katherine seeks to use her training and skills to provide you with hope and healing, as well as mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being in a multiculturally sensitive and safe environment.

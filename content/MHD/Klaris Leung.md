Hello there! I am a licensed Psychologist in New York and a Registered Clinical Psychologist in Hong Kong with over 10 years of experience. I work with adults, teens and their families who face challenges such as major life changes and stresses, depression and anxiety, trauma and bereavement. My practice is informed by a range of evidence-based approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and EMDR. As everyone is unique, we will come together to decide the best approach that fits your change and growth. I am currently seeing all clients through online therapy sessions in English, Cantonese and Mandarin.

As a licensed psychologist in NY and NJ, I offer remote individual psychotherapy to adults. My approach is collaborative, and you are an active partner in designing your personal goals. I individualize treatment based on your presenting concerns/needs as well as your unique background and history. Based on my training and experience in a variety of treatment modalities, including CBT, DBT, and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, I use an integrative approach to help you reach your personal goals, which may involve learning skills to manage lifeâ€™s difficulties and developing greater understanding of yourself. <br>
I have more than 15 years of experience working various settings, including hospitals and schools. As a trained pianist and a former Licensed Creative Arts Therapist, I also incorporate creative expression in my practice. My speciality also includes issues related to cultural diversity (e.g., LGBTQIA+, Asian American mental health, immigration). <br>
In my practice, I strive to create a safe, respectful, and nonjudgmental space, and to build an authentic connection with each of my clients. As a native of Japan, I am bilingual in Japanese and English, and offer services in both languages.

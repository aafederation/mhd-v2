I am out of network for all insurances. However, the majority of my patients use their insurance out of network benefits. Patients typically get reimbursed 50-80% of the session fee using their benefits. I work with Reimbursify so that you can use your out of network insurance benefits with ease.  
Total out-of-pocket cost can differ based on your insurance out-of-network coverage. 
Some availability to offer a sliding scale, depending on circumstances.
Please visit website to find out more about insurance benefits.

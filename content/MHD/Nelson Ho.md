I am a relational psychotherapist  specializing in treating LGBTQt BIPOC ages 17-95 years old  who struggle with social anxiety, anxiety and depression. I utilize a collaborative and  eclectic approach when guiding and aiding my clients in enhancing their positive qualities and dissipating any unhelpful thought or behavioral patterns they may face.

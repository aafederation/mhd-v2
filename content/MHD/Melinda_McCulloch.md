I believe healing primarily happens through our relationships with one another. My work prioritizes creating a strong therapeutic relationship in which you feel safe enough to explore old wounds, current stressors, and changes that would make your life better. I bring my expertise in mental health combined with evidence-based techniques and a warm, empathetic posture to collaborate with you on your goals. I specialize in working with adoptees and their families, or others who are navigating issues of identity, attachment/intimacy, or grief and loss.

I am an Asian American, cis woman, who is committed to the work of anti-racism, LGBTQIA+ affirmation, and equity for all. My training includes CBT, TF-CBT, EMDR, Mindfulness, and Theraplay among others. I have over a decade of providing psychotherapy for children, teens, and adults as well as several years prior working in program development for immigrants and youth.

When something doesn't feel right in your life, it's worth exploring what it could mean. Whether you are an individual or a couple, our work together will deepen your insight and prepare you for the emergence of new possibilities.

<br>

You are the best source of your own healing. We work together to find an effective approach in pursuit of your interests. To address the diverse intersection of issues that may arise, I draw from an eclectic array of therapeutic methods to be responsive to you and your growth.

<br>

Unhealed wounds from trauma, childhood circumstances or present day difficulties, can reside in our psyche and in our bodies. Processing experience through analysis, relational dynamics and powerful techniques like EMDR brings healing, wholeness and the possibility of vibrant flow in your life.

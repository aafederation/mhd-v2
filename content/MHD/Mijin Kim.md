I specialize in helping adolescents and adults with various origins and types of anxiety, depression, and trauma, with associated behavioral issues including substance abuse, eating disorder, and other addiction issues. I also work with those with relationship and family issues, sexuality and gender issues, and other social adjustment issues. I value working with clients who strive for various goals in life but have difficulties achieving them because of internal inhibitions or circumstantial challenges. It is one of my clinical emphases to help clients understand and overcome their psychological blockages. <br>
I utilize a combination of psychodynamic approaches based in relational, analytical, and existential psychology in conjunction with CBT and DBT with focus on mindfulness. I also employ EMDR, IFS, EFT, Imago Therapy, ACT, psychodrama, and other creative therapeutic modalities such as music, art, and play. I additionally specialize in CBT-I (CBT for insomnia). <br>
My clinical work in essence is to help clients unearth their intrinsic desires and motivations in order for them to re-assess their current priorities and positions in relation to their truer needs, find a new psychological orientation, if needed, and to start moving in a direction that's meaningful and responsive to their desires. <br>

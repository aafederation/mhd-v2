Life can throw many curve balls in a spur of a moment. However, you do not have to be alone in dealing with the psychological and emotional impact of these unpredictable and chaotic situations. You can acquire effective cognitive, emotional, and resilient strategies to overcome any stressor. You can place your trust and confidence in someone who is non-judgmental, empathetic, and patient in walking with you in this process.  
I have over 5 years of experience in treating anxiety, depression, mood disorders, and behavioral issues to name a few. Although my primary treatment approaches are CBT, motivational interviewing, solutions-focused therapy, and psychodynamic therapy, I am eclectic in my approaches, meeting you where you are at in your stage of life.  
Join me in rebuilding your inner strength and spirit through collaboration and partnership. There is light and hope at the end of the tunnel!

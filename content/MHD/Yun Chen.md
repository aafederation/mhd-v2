I am Dr. Yun Chen, a licensed clinical psychologist. If I have the pleasure to work with you, I will help you find the answers to three questions: (1) what do I want? (2) How to get there? and (3) what's getting in the way? Your answers to these questions will guide you towards a meaningful life. I look forward to joining you on the journey of self discovery, exploration, understanding, and eventually, making changes happen.

I focus my practice on managing anxiety, depression, anger, relational conflict, substance abuse, personality disorders, trauma, and impulsive behavior. I specialize in populations affected by minority stress, including stigma associated with ethnic, gender, and sexual identities. I take a non-judgemental and compassionate stance with my clients. By attuning to their unique needs, I help clients understand the cause of their suffering and pain and work to help them facilitate change in pursuit of a life that feels authentic, valued, and worth living.

I sensed a calling to help survivors of abuse, and became well versed in treating trauma, depression, anxiety, and stress, because many survivors experience these symptoms. My arts background helped me become a flexible, creative, and intuitive counselor. I weave insight oriented talk and creative therapies with research-backed therapy techniques along with compassion, and hundreds of people have responded well to it. I use EMDR, Cognitive Processing Therapy, and Trauma Focused CBT to help clients gain insight on themselves and move forward in their lives.

If you’re looking for a therapist who is passionate about helping you move from feeling like you’re helpless against symptoms you experience into someone who has the skills to keep making progress, you’ve found her.

<br>

If you want to take joy in your daily life instead of just getting through them, I can help you get there. If there have been too many days feeling depressed, anxious, or constant flashbacks and recurring thoughts about painful situations - and you want to be free of that, I’m here for you.

<br>

If you feel at times like your body isn’t your own, I can help you understand what’s going on so you can reclaim it.

<br>

If you’re ready to work with someone who wants to walk with you on your healing journey, you’re in the right place.

<br>

If you’ve ever felt that you can’t take back your life and that discouragement will always be with you, I could state that this isn’t true based on 18 years of experience.

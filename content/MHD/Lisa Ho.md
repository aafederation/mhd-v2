My therapeutic approach incorporates both systemic and relational pieces. We do not exist in a vacuum. All of our experiences shape the person we are today. In therapy, we are not just working on your mental, but your physical and spiritual health, as all these dimensions will impact how you feel. I use a behavioral approach that is uniquely my own with pieces drawing heavily from CBT and Acceptance and Commitment therapy. I have a special interest in working with OCD POC as I have found that many times OCD providers lack cultural competency needed to address the core issues.  
  
As a queer person, I use an LGBTQ affirming approach to treatment. I've also worked closely with trans and gender-diverse adolescents and adults.

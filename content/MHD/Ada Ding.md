I am accepting new clients - individuals and couples! I am a first-gen Asian-American licensed therapist in New York and specialize in working with young adults experiencing anxiety, depression, life transitions, racial trauma, relationships issues, and eating disorders. I am also passionate about working with couples around issues involving communication, intimacy, and managing conflict. My approach with clients is warm, collaborative and relational. I have additional training in TF-CBT and DBT.


Together, we will collaborate to define and work toward your goals, building a toolbox of skills to attain your full potential. You can expect to leave sessions feeling validated and empowered. I am here to offer unconditional support on your path to achieving emotional freedom.


Sliding scale options available. In-person or Telehealth sessions available.

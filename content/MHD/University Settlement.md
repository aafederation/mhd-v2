University Settlement has been offering the individuals and families we serve resources by which they can learn, grow, and thrive since 1926. To this day, we are proud to be at the forefront of social service providers in the Broadway-Slavic Village neighborhood. By removing barriers to help families overcome poverty, we empower citizens to maximize their potential and reach their goals. We do this by protecting and educating children, advancing literacy and job readiness, providing nutritious and sustaining meals, strengthening families, and serving the elderly.

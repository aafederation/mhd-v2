Charlene Chan is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker serving New York and New Jersey. She specializes in depression, self-esteem, relationship issues, social anxiety, and recovery from trauma. Many of Charlene’s clients seek therapy because they are struggling to find or assert their own voice, are looking to work through childhood trauma, or are hoping to process overwhelming events and emotions. Charlene also works with couples who feel like they are stuck in the same loop within their arguments, or couples who are striving to rekindle their relationship.  
  
After receiving her Masters in Social Work from New York University, Charlene completed psychodynamic psychotherapy training from the Psychoanalytic Training Institute of New York Counseling and Guidance Service. She also obtained her Certificate in EFT: Attachment Science in Practice. She collaborates with her clients to gain insight into better understanding themselves – she takes into consideration any pivotal moments throughout their lives, while also incorporating some solutions-oriented techniques to help with daily stressors. After treatment, clients have shared how therapy has helped them to see things more clearly, to understand their triggers more, and to feel in a healthier mental state.  
  
Charlene believes in the transformative power of a strong therapeutic alliance, and she fosters a supportive, nurturing environment where clients can explore emotions and issues as they arise. Clients have described Charlene as being able to effortlessly put them at ease, especially if they are first-time therapy seekers, and that her empathetic responses and expressions help them to feel heard and understood.

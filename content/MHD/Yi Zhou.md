Serving the Capital Region, I provide Telehealth and in-person sessions. My clients and I work together to navigate through mental health challenges and transitions in life. I specialize in working with people with gender dysphoria and those in the process of transition. Furthermore, I help my clients navigate issues related to racial identity and minority experiences. I work with various relationship types and forms, non-monogamy included. I enjoy helping couples, partners and families achieve a greater sense of unity and satisfaction in their lives. Counseling can also be provided through Mandarin upon request.

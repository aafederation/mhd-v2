During nearly 20 years of clinical experience in the US and mainland China, Victoria has developed an integrated, trauma-informed, attachment-focused, systemically-oriented approach to working with individuals (children, adolescents, adults), couples, and families on a variety of issues ranging from depression & anxiety to relational patterns, from abuse & neglect to grief & transition. Working within a systemic and trauma-informed approach, she may draw from cognitive-behavioral techniques, art & play, narrative therapies, and EMDR, while collaborating with the client throughout the therapy relationship. She conducts therapy in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese.

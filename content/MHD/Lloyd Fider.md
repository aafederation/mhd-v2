As they say, the only thing permanent in this world is change. Change, like people, comes in different shapes and sizes. It could be as simple as changing clothes, to more complex ones like a break up, death, or coming out. My goal is to help you manage and deal with changes in your life. By providing you with a safe and comfortable environment and my use of various therapeutic techniques, my hope is that you will feel supported, heard, understood, and obtain the necessary coping skills to help you through this journey called life.  
I have worked with adults, adolescents, and children, with issues ranging from trauma, relationships, grief/loss, self-esteem and identity. My approach is collaborative and tailored to your personal needs.

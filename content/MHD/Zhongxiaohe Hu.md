Happy to meet you here! I have conducted more than 3500 sessions with adolescents, adults, and families for a wide range of issues. Whether you are experiencing anxieties, uncertainties, sadness, transitions, grief, or loss, or you want to explore who you are, what you want to do academic and career-wise, your family and relationship dynamics, I can help. Currently, I'm an NYS bilingual psychotherapist and a supervisor certified to provide CBT and IPT treatments. I am also an LGBTQ+ affirmative therapist. I adopt an integrative approach to best support every unique client. Learn more about me and my approach: hupsychology.com
Together, we will explore and process the past, present, and future together, making sense of our experience. We will identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that negatively influence behavior and emotions. We will also develop concrete tools that help you cope with emotional and behavioral challenges outside of the sessions.
Together we create a collaborative, safe, open-minded, and trusting space where your worth is honored, vulnerability is unconditionally accepted without fear of judgment. As a woman of color and an Asian immigrant living in the U.S., I deeply relate to your experience and would love to support your sense of fulfillment and be your ally of social justice.

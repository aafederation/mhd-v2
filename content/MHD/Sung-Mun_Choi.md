I work with individuals experiencing anxiety, depression, trauma and support in exploring identity and relationship dynamics. I have a deep understanding of symptoms of stress and trauma that accumulate in our bodies. My practice is rooted in mindfulness, compassion, integrating psychodynamic and somatic therapeutic models.

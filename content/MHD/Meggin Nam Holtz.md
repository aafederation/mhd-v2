I received my MSW from the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College with a focus on child and adolescent trauma in the clinical setting. I provide therapy to youth, adolescents, families, and adults utilizing a strengths-based, trauma-informed, attachment, culturally and racially sensitive, and adoption-informed lens. As a transracial adoptee, I have a personal connection with adoption, and enjoy working with adoptees. I also hold a BFA in dance from SUNY Purchase and enjoy bringing creativity into the therapeutic space.

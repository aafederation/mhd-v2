As a mental health counselor, my goal is to help all my clients explore their inner strength and to assist them with understanding themselves better. My style is collaborative, warm, and empathic. I aim to create a safe and open space where my clients can feel heard and understood. I believe therapy work is truly meaningful as I get to be part of my clients’ wellness journey. I am highly trained and worked extensively with marginalized populations who struggle with depression, anxiety, trauma, life transition issues, and cultural issues.  
  
I work with high functioning and low-risk clients who has no history of psychiatric hospitalization. I utilize eclectic approaches including CBT, Gestalt, and DBT interventions. I strive to provide not only emotional support but tangible resources to my clients by providing individualized care plans that meet each client’s unique situations and goals.  
As your mental health counselor, I am going to walk with you step by step throughout your life journey. Please do not hesitate to email me. I am going to respond within 48 hours.

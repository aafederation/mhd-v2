Hello! I've been practicing therapy for over a decade now and have found that the approach that works best with me and my clients is a down-to-earth, authentic style of therapy where we can cut through the nuances to get to a solution! I used evidence-based models to address anxiety and depression while using authenticity and empathy to feel like we're just chatting at a coffee shop. One of the most important things is your comfort level with your therapist. I try to work hard to build that rapport with all my clients!

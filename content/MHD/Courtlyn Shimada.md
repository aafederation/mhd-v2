Hello! I’m Courtlyn Shimada, a therapist with a passion for understanding you and how you thrive. Therapy can be joyful and healing, as well as challenging. Through the highs, lows, and plateaus, I am committed to creating a warm and empowering space where together we can explore any obstacles that life may present. <br>
In our sessions, therapy is a collaborative process where you are the expert on your own experiences, and I’m here to offer structured support and guidance. I draw upon my social work background to offer a holistic approach, considering not only individual dynamics but also the impact of the broader environment and societal systems. Together, we may navigate through feelings of depression, anxiety, or grief, and struggles with chronic illness or significant life changes. <br>
Whether short-term or long-term, I believe in goal-oriented therapy. Don’t worry, though – if you don’t know what your goals are yet, we can figure them out together! My therapeutic toolkit includes practices such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, and Strength-Based Psychodynamic and Narrative Therapy. Depending on where our journey takes us, we may also tap into practices such as mindfulness, meditation, art, and writing as ways to deepen the work we do together. <br>
I bring with me a background in community development and activism within Asian American spaces. This perspective informs my intersectional, strength-based practice that recognizes your background, knowledge, and skills. As a clinician, I am dedicated to advocating for accessible and intergenerational mental health services for communities of color. <br>

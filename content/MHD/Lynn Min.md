<br>
I believe every dysfunction, every disorder, and every pain was somehow born to cope with life and protect the best parts of us. In the journey towards healing, we all need a power greater than ourselves (call it God, love, or family...) to provide acceptance, support, and a safe place to unravel. Counseling is an invitation to come and be; to take an honest look at yourself for who and what you really are; to realize your issues make sense; and to have compassion for all parts of you so you can holistically heal and function at your full potential. <br>
It's a sacred space where it's ok not to be ok. A place to think about why we do what we do. A place to express all of the different voices in our heads. A place to feel unveiled and free.
A place to be present in the now, reaching back into our pasts and out into our future. A place to explore the rich complexity of our human selves. <br>

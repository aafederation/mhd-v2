My clinical psychology doctoral training and numerous years of delivering psychotherapy have provided me with extensive experience helping adults with anxiety, depression, relationship issues, substance abuse, trauma, identity exploration, adjustment and life transition issues, and other life situations  
  
Therapy is a collaborative approach, where I am warm, empathic, curious, and nonjudgmental and can help you create and live a life you find fulfilling. My integrative approach is well-suited for addressing interpersonal and multicultural issues. I work from a social justice-oriented and trauma-informed lens to provide you with culturally competent treatment.

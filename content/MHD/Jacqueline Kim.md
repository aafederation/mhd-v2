I am trained in Dialectical Behavior Therapy from Behavioral Tech. I treat both adolescents and adults who struggle with a variety of emotional and behavioral issues. DBT is a skills based program that has been effective in teaching individuals to replace destructive behaviors with more effective skills. I am also a candidate in psychoanalytic training and am excited to provide psychodynamically-driven sessions.

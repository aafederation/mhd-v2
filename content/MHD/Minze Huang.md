Hi! I'm Minty, a Licensed Therapist in NYC. I work with people from a diverse background using culturally sensitive approach -we learn from each other. I work with adults dealing with issues of depressive mood, low self-esteem, anxiety and stress, cultural adjustment, as well as relationship struggles. I also work with Children and Adolescent. I had clinical experience in hospital psychiatric department, outpatient clinic and public schools.

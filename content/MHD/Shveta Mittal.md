I am a licensed therapist, certified psychedelic practioner, and leather lifestylist with more than a decade of experience helping clients develop a better understanding of themselves while facilitating improved coping, insight and personal growth. I have worked specifically with first responders and individuals holding multiple minority identities, providing culturally competent care from a sex-positive, person-centered, trauma-informed lens.Â

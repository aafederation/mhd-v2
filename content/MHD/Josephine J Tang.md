I have worked with individuals and couples from diverse backgrounds, including various ethnicities, LGBTQ and Straight orientations, native and non-native speakers. My specialization encompasses a wide array of issues such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, acculturation, cross-cultural challenges, life and career transitions, low self-esteem, personal growth, trauma, loss and grief, relationship dynamics, and stress management.

Taking the courageous step to acknowledge your challenges is the initial stride towards resolving them. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to collaborate with you, guiding our journey towards your goals.

Originally from Hong Kong, I am fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.

I’m Nira, a psychotherapist and yoga instructor, and I’m passionate about helping clients feel more grounded and connected to life. I guide clients to understand themselves more deeply, learn how to manage challenges, and embrace life in a different way– so that those intense waves feel easier to move through. My aim is to support you in finding a sense of “joy”, which does not necessarily mean being happy all the time, but finding peace in both the good and bad in life.

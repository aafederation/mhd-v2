Hello! My name is Ivy Kwong. I have been a therapist for over sixteen years and am a lifelong student of the healing arts. I see and honor your commitment to invest in your mental health and wellness at this point on your journey.

<br>

I am a second-generation Asian-American, female, queer, middle-class, able-bodied, spiritual, sex-positive therapist. I am the daughter of immigrants from Hong Kong and Macau, a survivor of childhood and adult sexual abuse and assault, a certified yoga instructor, a retired Professional Dominatrix, a children's book author, a divorcee, an artist, a writer, a stepparent of five children between the ages of 8-18, and a social justice advocate. I hold all of these identities equally with great love and honoring. In our work together, you will be seen, honored, and supported as all of who you are, as you have been, and as you will become.

<br>

I was born in the Midwest to lower middle-class Chinese immigrant parents. We lived in Indiana where there was a strong KKK presence and in Michigan, close to where Vincent Chin was murdered in a racial hate crime. My parents learned in order to survive, they had to stay quiet and invisible while working hard, silencing their struggles and swallowing their pain.

<br>

We inherit trauma, grief, and survival mechanisms passed down from our ancestors. We also inherit incredible power, strength, and wisdom. You are your ancestor's greatest dream. I believe it is an honor to have the chance to do the sacred work to heal ourselves now, and in doing so healing generations before and after us.

<br>

As for what you may expect in our work together, I invite you into the Unknown. Your mind can only take you to places to where you have already been. Much of our work together involves less of the mind and more connecting with and moving with and from your physical, emotional, cellular, and intuitive bodies. For many years, I have been studying and practiced healing techniques and perspectives far beyond what was learned in grad school and these may be offered as possibilities in our work together. We can consider scientific, evidence-based practices and we can also work with the Earth, with energy, with our breath, and with our Ancestors. Everything offered is just one possibility of infinite possibilities, and you are always encouraged and supported in connecting with and powerfully practicing what resonates most deeply for you.

I believe this work is sacred work. It is not easy, but I believe it is the most important work we can do in this lifetime: The work to reclaim ourselves, our healing, and our Greatest and Highest Truth. To reclaim it all, and to live from this space of joy, peace, power, and the full spectrum of what Life is and can be.

<br>

I offer trauma-informed, culturally-responsive, identity-affirming, and anti-oppressive therapy and coaching for individuals, groups, and organizations. My work with you is to be a mirror (for both your blind spots and for your greatness that you may not yet be able to see), a guide (to provide you with tools and support as you navigate new and unfamiliar terrain), and an advocate (recognizing the impact of social, political, economic, and cultural factors when it comes to health and wellness and advocating for my clients beyond the therapy session via social justice work).

<br>

You are offered the option of opening each session with a brief grounding meditation, inviting in whatever may be in your highest and greatest good to address and observing what arises (a person, image, memory, phrase, etc.). We can start there, or we can dive right in and begin. I am committed to creating and protecting a safe, supportive, non-judgmental, empowering, and affirming space for you to show up as you are and for all of your emotions, memories, and Essence to be welcomed as they are. You are always welcome and encouraged to tell me if something does not work for you, if you are angry or upset with me, and if there is something you are not getting that you need. You know yourself best, and I am here to work with you to ensure the quality, transparency, and integrity of your care. My style is intuitive, compassionate, and direct. I offer "invitations" (because nobody likes "homework") for you to practice after each session that will involve practicing doing things differently to get different results.

<br>

Your journey of healing is precious and unique. It will look different from anyone else's, as it will be exclusively yours. I integrate elements of coaching in my work and a diverse range of evidence-based practices plus a vast spectrum of Eastern and Western healing tools and techniques that include but are not limited to: traditional therapeutic orientations including psychodynamic, psychosomatic, IFS, and experiential therapy, mindfulness, breathwork, meditation, inner child work, ancestral work, and much more. Possibilities of our collaboration in honor of your healing may range from "scientific and evidence-based" to deep spiritual and ancient ancestral work. We will work together to co-create a highly personalized space for your healing.

<br>

You are welcome to visit my website at BareIvy.com to learn more. I encourage you to speak with and interview different therapists on your search as everyone is very different with their unique gifts and ways of practicing. I wish you the very best on your journey of healing, growth, and thriving. Whether we work together or not, I am so glad you are on this path as deeper healing for one is deeper healing for all.

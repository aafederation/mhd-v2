Hello. My name is Kanako Okuda. I am a licensed clinical social worker in New York State with over 20 years of experience helping individuals from various walks of life. I earned my Doctorate of Social Work from Rutgers School of Social Work and a Masterâ€™s Degree from Columbia University. I have worked with parents of children with life-challenging diseases and adults of all ages. I have also helped them successfully manage major life transitions, chronic health conditions, coping with educational anxiety, and dealing with work challenges. <br>
One of my specialties is in managing educational anxiety. I have several years of experience counseling students through their college careers, as well as offering counseling to professionals regarding work-related issues. I've provided counseling at schools, in the home environment, in hospitals, and through web-based platforms. The premise of my work is based on positive psychology. I want to help you cultivate the best parts of you to enhance the areas of your life that you may feel the need to change. <br>

Kim (they/them) is passionate about supporting people along their healing journeys and paths of self-discovery. Kim doesn’t believe individuals seek out therapy because they are “flawed” or need to be “fixed.” Instead, Kim views therapy as a powerful act of self-care when navigating challenging systems, -isms, circumstances and relationships. Their own lived experience as a neurodivergent Korean adoptee drives their commitment to practicing from a place that holds space for - and celebrates - each person’s multiple and intersecting identities.

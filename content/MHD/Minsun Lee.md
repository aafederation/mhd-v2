I am a licensed psychologist in NY and NJ and an associate professor in the Counseling Psychology PhD Program at Seton Hall University. I work with adults (aged 18 and older), and my clinical specialty is in helping individuals and couples make sense of their emotional, relational, gendered, cultural, and racial experiences and how these are connected to their distress.

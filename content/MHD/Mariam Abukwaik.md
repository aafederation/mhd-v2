Thanks for being here and taking this step towards seeking care especially adding in all the social dynamics at play....  so please be proud of yourself. <br>
In terms of social identities, I am Muslim, South Asian and Arab, and a woman of color. <br>
I’m happy to share more about me and the work I do. We can’t cover everything in a bio, but I’d be happy to answer any other questions you have during a consultation call. <br>
My social previously mentioned identities have been crucial throughout my training and provided insight into particular issues, but of course, I needed to do a lot of learning as well. Therapy/Social Work provided me the space to learn about others, and how to engage in community building. My identities, particularly being a culturally mixed individual, created a curiosity in me about other struggled. I grew up with two cultures and saw how interconnected they were even if the communities couldn't see. I saw divides between other communities as well. Being mixed made me feel like I needed to be a bridge. To this day, I want to work with others within my cultures and across cultures to inspire healing and connection towards liberation. This inspires my practice today when working with a client. Both our identities are in the room, and I hope that our conversations can lead to healing, connection, and emotional, mental, and inevitably physical/tangible liberation. <br>

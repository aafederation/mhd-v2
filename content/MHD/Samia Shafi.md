My therapy practice is grounded in building meaningful collaborative relationships with my clients since I believe communication is the foundation for insight and growth. I respect each client’s individuality and aim to support people in becoming the best version of themselves. I strive to create a space where people feel comfortable expressing themselves honestly and it’s possible to better understand, navigate, and heal from challenging experiences over time.

<br>

It is important to me to acknowledge the impact of socioeconomic and historical conditions on people’s lives. I am particularly committed to supporting people of color and others from marginalized communities to overcome trauma and hardships and experience more joy, love, and fulfillment in their lives.

I am a proud queer and multicultural therapist of Tongan, Mexican, and European descent. I believe that we are the experts of our own experiences and that our intersecting identities shape these experiences. Growing up in a multicultural household taught me the significance of culture in shaping our identities and relationships. Informed by intersectional feminist theory, I provide a space that centers clientsâ€™ unique identities and cultural backgrounds in the healing process.

<br>

My approach to therapy is collaborative, exploratory, culturally responsive and trauma-informed. I work to create a healing relationship based on authenticity and empathy, where I honor clients as holistic individuals. I help clients engage in self discovery, honor their authenticity and intentionally forge their life paths.I am passionate about supporting adolescents, adults, and couples who are coping with family conflict, anger management, identity development, low self-esteem, parenting stress, anxiety, acculturation and racial stress, and intergenerational trauma.

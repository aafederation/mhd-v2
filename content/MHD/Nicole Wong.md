Hello! My name is Nicole Wong (she/her) and I am a Licensed Master Social Worker in New Yorkâ€™s Hudson Valley. I specialize in helping adults, adolescents, and children heal from trauma, overcome anxiety, and relinquish their self-doubt. Your voice deserves to be heard and listened to. I would so appreciate the opportunity to engage in this therapeutic process with you.

In my work, I provide trauma-informed, strengths-based, and person-centered therapy to my clients, while integrating an empathic, intersectional, and holistic approach. My practice is grounded in allowing my clients to explore all aspects of their identities while working through their life experiences. It is important to me that you are in control of your therapeutic process and that our work together is collaborative in its approach and catered to meet your needs and goals.

Prior to my transition to being a therapist, I worked for nine years in trauma and anti-violence, university administration, and nonprofit management. For most of my professional career, I have helped individuals heal from trauma and loss and advocated for survivors in their communities. My foundations in trauma-informed approaches and advocacy remain a strong tenet of my work with clients today.

I earned my Masters of Science degree in Social Work at Columbia University in Advanced Clinical Practice with a focus on Health, Mental Health, and Disabilities. Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and English from Vassar College.

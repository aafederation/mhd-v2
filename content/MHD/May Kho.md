Many people seek therapy because they feel stuck, hopeless, or confused. It takes courage to ask for help and address hard issues causing hardship or stress. Whether you are struggling with self-esteem issues, anxiety, depression, addiction, or just having a tough time shaking the feeling that something's not quite right, starting therapy can be a great way to explore those issues. With a compassionate and collaborative approach, I will create a safe environment for us to identify what is holding you back from living a happier and healthier life.

<br>

With a background in psychodynamics and trauma-informed care, I believe many problems are rooted in the attachments and relationship dynamics we form with others early in life. By gaining awareness of our own interpersonal habits and patterns, we are empowered to create new connections with others in a healthy manner.

<br>

I draw from a wide range of treatment modalities including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness practice, motivational interviewing, strengths-based techniques, and solution-focused therapy. I will work with you to adopt an individualized approach that best fits your needs.

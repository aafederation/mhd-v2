Breathwork had a profound impact on my life at a time when I was struggling to hear my true inner calling. It helped me release blockages I didn't even know were there, and suddenly after a decade of working in the corporate world, I made the decision to take an entirely different path: one that is nourishing, rewarding, and serving my community.

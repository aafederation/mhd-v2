I am a licensed psychologist in both California and New York and have had private practices in the San Francisco Bay Area and now in NYC. I earned my B.A. in psychology from Barnard College, Columbia University, and my M.A. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from St. Johnâ€™s University. Prior to private practice, I was a staff psychologist at Notre Dame de Namur Counseling Services, where I provided therapy to undergraduate and graduate students, and I also provided training and supervision to therapists-in-training.

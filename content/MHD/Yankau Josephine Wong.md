I am a seasoned therapist who uses both relational and insight-oriented approaches to help individuals and couples to achieve great emotional, behavioral and relational health. The work is realized mainly through tapping to the patient's own inner and external resources and organizing them in ways that are helpful and meaningful to them. My work is based on a deep exploration of one's sense of self that is shaped by their culture, values, spirituality and other essential components in their lives. I have enjoyed working in a cross-cultural, cross-sectional manner with all of my valued patients.

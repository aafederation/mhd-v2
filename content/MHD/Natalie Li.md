Natalie Li is a psychiatric nurse practitioner with experience in psychopharmacology and medication management. Her background as a first-generation immigrant contributes to a deep appreciation of the healing modalities in Eastern and Western cultures. She is familiar with integrative psychiatric treatments and focused on establishing a trusting and supportive relationship.  
Being a psychiatric nurse practitioner has become an effective channel for my strong desire to help others find contentment and harmony. Growing up in China, I've gained a solid understanding of how mental health is stigmatized. I've seen firsthand how families fail to recognize and address the suffering associated with mental illness. Furthermore, I've seen how these challenges are swept under the rug with sadness and shame. In my work, I strive to reverse the stigma by helping others understand mental health struggles with greater acceptance and empathy while providing evidence-based treatments from an integrative framework.  
  
I believe that an inner intelligence resides within everyone and allows them to heal. My responsibility is to facilitate my clients in strengthening that part of themselves so that they can heal on their own terms with a strong sense of agency.  
  
I think the most important core values for me are to be authentic, caring, and present for my clients with a nonjudgmental and open-minded approach.  
  
Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy makes me excited and feels hopeful that instead of merely managing the symptoms, the future of psychiatry can strive to address the root causes of human suffering. I have completed 6-month ketamine provider training and 12 months of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy training through the Integrative Psychiatry Institute, and I feel honored to have witnessed so many inspiring clients officially start their true healing journey after completing their ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions in the clinic I used to work at. Now, I am thrilled to utilize ketamine as one of the healing tools in my practice.

Do you think about what kind of person you'd like to be, but feel uncertain about how to make the change? Perhaps you feel like certain areas of your life such as relationships or work can be more fulfilling, but you're not sure how to get there. If you hope to live up to your potential and feel more clarity, peace, and freedom, you've come to the right place. I am here to support you in making powerful changes to your life with confidence, humour, and joy, bit by bit. 

<br>

I am a Taiwanese-Canadian psychologist educated in the US, with 13+ years of experience. I marry the wisdom of Buddhist thought and the science of psychology to raise your self-awareness and exploration to the next level. I also use a multicultural lens to help you understand your context, and the environments that have shaped who you are. I have fine tuned my approach to turn "becoming your best self" from abstract to reality, whether it is related to your personal, racial, or cultural identities, relationships, or work. By striking a balance between guidance, open exploration, and support, I can help you demystify the change process, so that you can become the master of your own life.

I am a bi-cultural mixed South Asian and Ashkenazi Jewish New Yorker, and I ground my practice in an anti-racism anti-oppression framework. I honor the many intersecting identities and lived experiences of my clients, knowing how much of a toll it can take on one’s mind and body to have to navigate daily life within oppressive and triggering environments. My holistic approach is to co-create a space where we can explore aspects of your identities, like your cultural upbringing, family dynamics, gender, race, religion, class, abilities, or sexuality. I believe every client is an expert on their own experience. My wish is for each person I work with to become empowered by cultivating a deeper understanding of their experiences, and a greater love for themselves and their communities. We will hone in on your strengths and sources of fulfillment, explore concrete coping tools for navigating hardships, develop a practice of appreciating life's glimmers, and establish measurable goals to work toward. I specialize in working with clients who are experiencing major life transitions, navigating intergenerational family dynamics, moving through grief and relationship endings, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, substance abuse, domestic violence, sexual trauma, and Pandemic Fatigue. Depending on your unique needs we can utilize evidence-based modalities including trauma focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Solution Focused Therapy, Mindfulness meditation, and certain Somatic therapies.

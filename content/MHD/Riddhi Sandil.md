I believe that the client's experience, both in and out of the therapy room, is most important in a helping relationship. When working with me, you can expect an active and caring therapeutic approach that is centered around exploration and collaboration. I incorporate both cognitive and emotion focused approaches in my work and help you to examine patterns, behaviors, and processes that may no longer be useful. I also specialize in couples therapy and use a process oriented approach that is focused on understanding communication patterns, increasing emotional harmony, and overall relational satisfaction.


I received my PhD in Counseling Psychology in 2008 from the University of Iowa. I am a relational, culturally-responsive psychologist who is an Associate Professor at Columbia University. Using cognitive, multicultural, and interpersonal interventions, I am committed to client care that centers their needs.


With expertise in CBT, EFT, Couples Therapy, Racial Cultural Therapy, LGBTQ health, women's issues, and minority stress, my approach to treatment is client centered that is aimed at empowering you to create sustainable and appropriate changes in your life.

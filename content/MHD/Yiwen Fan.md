With an early passion in psychology, I moved from China to the US when I was 17. My experience as an Asian immigrant living in the U.S. enhanced my understanding of the humanity and struggles in all of us. Currently, I'm a NYS Licensed Mental Health Counselor and School Counselor. I'm also a certified Gestalt Therapist.

Since graduating from Columbia University in 2013, I have worked as a community therapist and bilingual school counselor in New York. I have extensive experience working with Chinese young professionals, college/high school students and immigrant adults from all over the world. During my work, I grew a deeper understanding of how past experiences motivate and restrict a person. Oftentimes, as we truly see the deep yearnings and wounds, healing begins. In 2020, I received systematic training from Dr. Mariela Shibley in mental health evaluations for immigration cases. I can provide these evaluations in Mandarin.

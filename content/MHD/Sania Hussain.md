In my practice, I strive to create a safe and comfortable environment where a trusting therapeutic relationship can be built. This has been, in my 18+ years of experience, the most effective way to ensure we can do meaningful work to achieve your goals. In this therapy journey, I hope to support and challenge you along the way, working collaboratively to help you live a more fulfilling life. Through my gentle guidance, clients are encouraged to be more open and introspective by identifying goals, becoming more aware of their maladaptive thoughts and behaviors, and empowering them to work towards their needs and wants.  
I provide psychotherapy in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. As a bicultural therapist, my approach is culturally-sensitive, integrative, and individualized. I also utilize my extensive experience in mindfulness and relaxation techniques to help keep you in the present and aware of your valueâ€¦instead of staying stuck in the past or worrying about the future!  
Besides NY & NJ, I have the ability to provide telepsychology to those residing in AL, AZ, AR, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, ME, MD, MN, MO, NE, NV, NH, NC, OH, OK, PA, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WV, WI, & WY. I also have years of supervisory experience, helping therapists with their individual clients.

Katherine Liaw is a Board Certified Licensed Creative Arts Therapist in New York. In 2016, she graduated from Hofstra University with a master’s degree in Creative Arts Therapy. Katherine believes that the creative process of art expression can foster self-awareness, self-esteem, emotional resiliency, and help clients gain fresh perspectives and insights in ways that talk therapy alone may not be able to. <br>
In 2011, Katherine felt called to work as an art therapist when she had opportunity to interact with women in a domestic violence shelter. She had a strong sense of desire to help others recover and find hope. <br>
Katherine was trained in a client-centered approach while working at a homeless shelter. She integrates an insight-oriented, CBT-informed approach when working with clients through art therapy. From her trainings and prior professional experience, she has worked with various age range(s) from adolescents to older adults, and helped those with grief and loss, anxiety, life transitions, trauma, low self-esteem, boundary and faith issues. <br>
To engage in art therapy, you don’t need to be artistically gifted or skilled; all you need is a willingness to explore the creative process and work toward healing! <br>

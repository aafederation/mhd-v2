I FIRMLY BELIEVE that you are an expert of your own life. I offer art therapy integrated with traditional talk therapy through a humanistic lens in order to support you on your journey towards self-awareness and self-acceptance.

<br>

CREATING ARTWORK can become a tool for communication when we cannot find the words to express ourselves, or words are just not enough. The process of art-making itself is a unique way of grounding and finding inner peace.

<br>

WORKING FROM A CLIENT-CENTERED and holistic approach, I strive to establish a safe and supportive environment where you may explore, play, and be creative.

<br>

TOGETHER, we can nurture your inner voice and develop long-lasting resiliency.

I believe that the ultimate goal of therapy is to alleviate pain and suffering, and that everyone has the capacity for growth and change. By developing a caring, empathic, and trusting relationship with my clients, it becomes possible to gain insight and clarity about relationships, problems and personal patterns. It is through this process that one can grow and realize a level of peace and acceptance. I also believe that genuine growth is only possible when I view the clients I work with through the lens of multiple personal identities (e.g., sexual orientation, gender) and cultural identities (e.g., race/ethnicity, religion). I am proficient in Mandarin and can understand 3 other Chinese dialects. Having lived in Asia a significant part of my life, I am familiar with Asian cultural issues.

As a master-level psychotherapist, I provide therapy services under the supervision of a licensed clinician. I am fluent in both English and Mandarin and have extensive experience working with clients of diverse backgrounds in clinic, non-profit, and private practice settings. I specialize in treating a range of mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, trauma, interpersonal relationships, and life transitions.

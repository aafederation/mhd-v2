I’m a Master of Social Work from University of Michigan and also a certified hypnotherapist. I help people who are physically and emotionally challenged and already tried traditional psychotherapy in the past. Even though I’m a well trained psychotherapist, I use hypnosis to bring my clients tremendous relief from a first session. I work with clients who are severely challenged such as terminal cancer pain management, panic attack, stuttering, eating and weight issues OCD, trauma and others. I fluently communicate in English and Japanese and my practice is based on psychology but being visible relief and result quicker than talking therapy. I provide Social Work services such as supervision on child visitation along with a court order and full psychiatric evaluation for law enforcement upon their request.

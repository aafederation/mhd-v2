Adhikaar, meaning rights, is a New York-based nonprofit organizing Nepali-speaking community to promote human rights and social justice for all.

<br>

To achieve our mission:

* We facilitate access to information and resources on immigration, health, workersâ€™ rights, and other issues;
* We organize the community to collectively advocate against social injustices and human rights abuses;
* We conduct participatory action research and policy advocacy on issues affecting our community;
* We build the leadership of members, with the focus on marginalized groups within the Nepali-speaking community.

As a therapist, my goal is to connect with you, learn about your unique story, and work together to help you achieve your goals. I enjoy working with a wide variety of people with different challenges. I'm committed to helping you gain real insight and traction towards your goals. I am hesitant to pathologize and view symptoms as natural adaptations and defenses to challenging or unsafe circumstances in one's developmental environment. Together we can explore these dynamics with curiosity and kindness and learn skills to meet these moments in new ways to experience a greater sense of choice and freedom in your life.   
  
I believe that having a solid therapeutic relationship is essential to help you make your goals a reality and to create a space where you feel respected, heard, safe, and validated. I strive to cultivate an environment for clients to feel safe, vulnerable, and free from bias and judgment.

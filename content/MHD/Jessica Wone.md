Do you find it difficult to slow down your thoughts? Are you feeling unfulfilled and unhappy, but just don't know why? You want to feel better but just don't know how. Therapy is a valuable resource for understanding yourself and bringing clarity to these unanswered questions. Through the process, you will gain personal insights, learn ways to cope with everyday life and feel more at ease. My approach with clients is collaborative, person-centered and integrative. What that means is that I believe in working with my clients to achieve the goals that they want to achieve.  I trust that people are the experts of their own lives and I just serve as a curious and open-minded guide.

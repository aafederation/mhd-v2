I lean into an eclectic and integrative approach when working with clients, one that uses aspects of psychodynamic and feminist therapy. I operate from a trauma-informed and multicultural background, and will meet you where you are. My work is centered around helping women of color navigate the difficulties that come with navigating those identities.

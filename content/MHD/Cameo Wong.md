My clinical practice is informed by a mix of psychoanalysis, solution-focused, motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. I provide support, guidance and reflection to the entire life spectrum (children, youth, adults, families and couples) as they face life difficulties, transitions, pain and suffering. My work with you is to utilize insights to create awareness, change, healing and restoration towards emotional wellness. I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area and provide teletherapy throughout California, New York and Massachusetts.

My name is Sam Patel and I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. I am passionate about working with children, adolescents, and young adults to process their experiences and feelings. <br>
In an increasingly online world, managing life's challenges can be difficult for young people. Adolescence is a complicated, exciting time; teens and young people are discovering who they are and what is important to them. Sometimes this transition can be overwhelming. I am here to partner with you on that journey and help you navigate the transitions. While I can offer support with the symptoms you are experiencing, I also like to delve deeper into understanding why patterns may have emerged so that we can discover what might not be serving us anymore. <br>
I received my bachelors in psychology from Tulane University and my masters in clinical social work from the University of Chicago. I have experience with young people struggling with challenges such as trauma, anxiety, depression, self esteem, eating disorders, and family relationships. I am also very passionate about working with people of color and LGBTQIA+ people. <br>

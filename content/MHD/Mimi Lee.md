Mimi is a doctor, artist and healer.


Mimi is a Stuyvesant, Juilliard, and Harvard-educated, American-born daughter of a Korean psychiatrist who witnessed the power if deeply interactive, devoted psychotherapy in alleviating suffering. Following in her fatherâ€™s footsteps, and fascinated with the human mind, Mimi pursued a PhD in Neuroscience while in medical school and pursued clinical training in Neurological Surgery where she observed the dynamic impact of physical injury and illness on our mental and emotional beings. Her own personal experiences with cultural and ethnic racism, gender inequality, cancer, infertility and divorce allows her to connect to clients experiencing similar life events with embodied compassion. Mimi guides clients towards strengthening emotional connections with their inner selves and building a toolbox of skills to safely acknowledge, understand and reframe experiences.

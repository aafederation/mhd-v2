I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who has been working in the field for over 10 years. I graduated from Hunter College with a focus in clinical practice with individuals and families. In my years in the field I have served a wide range of clientele, from adolescents to adults. I specialize in working with those that suffer from trauma, generalized anxiety, depression, personality disorders, eating disorders, substance use and addiction issues. In addition, as a POC therapist, I am familiar with issues of race and how they can impact ones mental health. <br>
My approach is person centered and non-judgmental, I believe that a collaborative approach to treatment is paramount. I support my clients in gaining insight to the root of their issues in order to come up with productive strategies to move forward and break out of unhealthy behavior patterns. My belief is in holistic healing and incorporate this regularly. <br>
I am here for you to start your therapeutic journey. Please reach out if you are interested in letting me be your guide. My main focus in modalities are cognitive behavioral therapy, narrative therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, solution focused and motivational interviewing. LGBTQIA+ affirming/Trauma/POC <br>

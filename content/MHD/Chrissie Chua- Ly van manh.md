I enjoy working with individuals who are intrigued with how their past have impacted their current selves. My clients desire to explore their past, current, and future. My goal is to help you better understand yourself and your patterns of thoughts and behaviors. I want to provide you with a warm and empathetic environment where your curiosities and needs are explored. I assist my clients to live more purpose-filled lives by identifying their strengths and values. I aim to provide a safe space for you at Rapoport Psychological Services where you will be understood and cared for without concerns of being minimized or dismissed.  
I believe each client is unique so I tailor my client centered approach from a variety of modalities; including, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance Commitment Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Mindfulness, and Psychodynamic techniques. I have experience with a wide range of diagnoses but specialize in anxiety, depression, and trauma.  
I know how difficult therapy can be and that's why I believe in developing a safe and open therapeutic relationship as the first essential step. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in session. I will always meet you where you're at- never challenging you (unless you are ready) and celebrating every small step you make towards success.

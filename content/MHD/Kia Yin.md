My clients work hard in relationships and at the workplace to meet their own high standards, but feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction often creep up despite their accomplishments. Every time they achieve a goal, a fleeting sense of happiness is soon replaced by the familiar feelings of emptiness and anxiety. I help my clients break this exhausting cycle. My clients will learn practical skills to approach challenging situations with increased flexibility and ease, make decisions that they believe in and feel good about, and find a sustained sense of meaning in life.

As a first-generation Chinese immigrant with a decade of experience working across diverse cultures, I bring curiosity and sensitivity to every encounter. I understand that systemic structures of power shape individuals’ experiences of privilege and oppression, and I strive to learn about how each of my clients’ unique lived experiences affects their responses to the world around them.

Prior to becoming a therapist, I was a product marketing manager at Google. Therapy helped me identify and live in line with my values, which has led to many changes, including becoming a therapist and a more fulfilling life. From my experience I am confident that change is possible, and I can't wait to work with you to start your unique journey of change.

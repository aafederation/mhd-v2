Hi, I'm Korey, a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner at Mindflow Psychiatry. My approach to mental health follows a holistic and wellness model. I use an egalitarian process which involves a shared decision-making model. Everyone is different and unique therefore the treatment plan will be unique and customized to fit your needs and goals.  
I utilize strategies such as holistic care and mindfulness to help clients build personal insight. I utilize geeky topics such as anime, video games, and DnD to help individuals improve their mental health and engage them through things that are of personal interest making the process more wholesome.

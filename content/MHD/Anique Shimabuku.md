My approach to therapy is rooted in anti-oppression and liberatory principles, seeking to honor each person’s individuality and autonomy. Much of my experience is working with people of color and queer and trans/gender non-conforming people. I have specialized training in trauma practice, particularly around experiences of abuse, violence, and intergenerational trauma. I draw from a variety of therapeutic techniques, including psychodynamic therapy, Internal Family Systems, mindfulness, and other relational and somatic approaches. I am a queer, mixed-race Asian American of Uchinanchu and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and my therapy space is warm and collaborative, fostering individuals’ ability to build resilience, joy, and power.

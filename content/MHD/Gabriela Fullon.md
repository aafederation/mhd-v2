I am a second generation, Filipino-American psychotherapist focused on providing healing spaces for and with people of color. I am an integrative practitioner bringing together psychodynamic, trauma informed practice, and somatic to help clients explore issues such as racial and cultural identity, class, family dynamics, and gender in order to move towards holistic healing.

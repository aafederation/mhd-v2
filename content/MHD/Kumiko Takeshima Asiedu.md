I am a licensed clinical social worker with more than 10 years of experience. I have extensive experience in helping and supporting clients with a different range of mental health issues and life challenges. I provide psychotherapy in English and Japanese. I have extraordinary experience working with people of Asian descent. 

I hold an LCSW license in New York State, allowing me to offer telehealth sessions to people in NY. I rely on a person-centered perspective by using warm, empathetic, and non-judgemental approaches. I focus on a relationship with my clients to work through psychological and behavioral issues. In addition, I use a strength based approach.  I believe that people have their own unique abilities to overcome any challenges.

Long before becoming a clinical social worker, Joey participated in community organizing for many years, volunteering his time to expand LGBTQIA acceptance and visibility in his hometown. One of Joeyâ€™s core values is empowering marginalized individuals and communities. With a desire to focus on providing mental health care, Joey obtained his Masters of Social Work degree from Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College in New York City. Soon after graduation, he obtained his LMSW license to practice as a clinician in New York. Joey has experience working with LGBTQIA people across many age groups, from youth to older adults. In addition, Joey has also worked with a general population of adults living with HIV/AIDS or other chronic illnesses. Currently, he continues to provide direct services in a community health center setting and seeing clients in private practice.

As a second-generation Asian American, I have an understanding and experience in providing therapy to those raised by immigrant parents. I am here to offer you help in processing any painful feelings and experiences such as guilt, shame, obligation, and/or sense of distance from your family that many feel growing up in two (or more) cultures. I see many Asian American adults and teens in my practice frequently dealing with family conflict, parenting, work stress, anxiety, and depression. Currently accepting new telehealth clients.

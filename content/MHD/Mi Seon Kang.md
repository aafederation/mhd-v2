As you embark on the courageous path of self-discovery and healing, connecting with a caring, collaborative, skillful therapist is a crucial first step. With years of experience, I offer a warm, reflective, and compassionate safe space that will enable you gain clarity, a greater sense of freedom and authenticity by exploring your unconscious and limited thought patterns/beliefs and experientially processing your unresolved past traumas.

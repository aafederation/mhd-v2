Welcome! As a trauma-informed psychotherapist, my dedication lies in helping individuals overcome life's challenges and embark on a transformative journey towards healing, meaning, and growth. Throughout my practice, I have had the privilege of working with individuals from diverse backgrounds and addressing a wide range of concerns. Recognizing the uniqueness of each client's journey, I embrace an open and collaborative approach to therapy, tailored to meet their specific needs and goals. By integrating evidence-based therapies with holistic methods, I provide comprehensive support to guide my clients towards meaningful growth, foster resilience, and live a life filled with purpose and authenticity.

Drawing upon the latest research in neuroscience and trauma-informed care, I have developed a deep understanding of the mind-body connection and the profound impact of pain and trauma on overall well-being. I firmly believe that every individual has the ability to heal and thrive. By providing a safe and supportive space, we can explore and process your experiences, nurture your inner child, and cultivate self-compassion. I am here to accompany you on your journey, and I am committed to supporting you every step of the way.

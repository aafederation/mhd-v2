I am a licensed clinical psychologist with 10+ years of experience. I provide short term and longer term therapy, depending on the clients' needs and goals. I am trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and psychodynamic interventions. I have clinical experience in different settings, including hospital, clinics, and college counseling centers. I used a client-centered approach and incorporate aspects of mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. I value the therapeutic relationship and understand the importance of a good therapeutic match.

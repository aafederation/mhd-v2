Maybe you overachieve as a way to soothe your inner child wounds. You’ve come so far from the discontent in your family of origin, but inside, you still struggle with high-functioning anxiety, high-functioning depression, feeling broken, feeling emotionally numb, self-doubt, or maybe even past traumas.

If you’re curious about yourself and want to heal past pains that may unknowingly affect you now, let’s talk.

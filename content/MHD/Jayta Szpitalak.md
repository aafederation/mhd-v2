Hi! I’m a Columbia University trained Counseling Psychotherapist. I graduated back in 2007 with my MA and Ed.M and have had my private practice from 2010 onwards. I specialize in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and have received extra training in Mindfulness, Yoga psychotherapy, Nutritional Psychology, and Neuroplasticity for anxiety.  
  
I believe that in order to truly improve mood, we must explore our emotions, lifestyle, nutrition, and exercise. All 4 systems have a bi-directional relationships and affect one another and contribute to your overall wellness. I am especially excited about the research disseminating out of the Nutritional Psychiatric framework as we are now understanding so much of our food and our microbiome affects our mood & brain health. I believe this approach speaks to the Asian community in particular because often Mental Health is still stigmatized, and now medical research is proving that there is more to our Mental health than previously understood. I work collaboratively with my clients, and I look forward to connecting with you.  
  
In 2013 I migrated to Sydney, Australia, however I still see my clients back in NYC via skype/zoom sessions. I do provide receipts so you can claim to your insurance. Many thanks for visiting my profile. If you would like to learn more about my therapeutic and science based approach, you can google me to read the various articles I’ve written for Mental Wellness in publications such as Vogue, Body & Soul, Teen Vogue, etc. Have a wonderful day.

If you're experiencing anxiety and depression, struggling to set boundaries in your relationships, or navigating challenging life transitions that are causing you to doubt yourself - you're not alone. I'm here to help you work through your trauma, release unhelpful relational and emotional patterns, and create the life you want to live. As an LGBTQ-affirming South Asian therapist, I understand the nuances of South Asian/pan-Asian cultures and queerness, and the way these, and other marginalized identities, can impact how we show up in relationships and move through the world. <br>
I believe in therapy that is collaborative, exploratory, and individualized. I specialize in working with young adults who are struggling with relationships and intimacy, codependency, complex family dynamics, gender identity and sexuality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression, and trauma. <br>
Therapy can be a transformative opportunity to create a life that feels more meaningful and authentic to you. In working together, I am committed to building a safe space from which you can process your emotions with compassion and curiosity. If this sounds like what you’re looking for, please don’t hesitate to reach out - I’m looking forward to meeting you! <br>

I believe that therapy is a place to practice a discipline of hopeâ€”while we examine past traumas and current challenges, together we'll also create a space that makes healing possible. With curiosity and care, we'll delve into your emotions and connect them to behaviors, explore the past and its impact on the present, analyze your relationships and roles within your community, and carve out opportunities for change. When you enter the therapeutic space, you bring a unique set of experiences shaped by the world at large, so together we'll acknowledge and work through the external contexts that impact your life. <br>
My work has primarily been with folks from immigrant, LGBTQ+, and BIPOC communities, as well as with adolescents and young adults. I draw from multiple disciplines, as well as my own experiences as a queer person of color, and emphasize an anti-oppressive, feminist, and queer-affirming approach to my practice. <br>
I use a variety of therapeutic modalities to create an integrative and holistic perspective, drawing from psychodynamic/psychoanalytic, cognitive behavioral (CBT), dialectical behavioral (DBT), narrative, and relational therapies. Together, we will identify what you want to be working through and let your insights guide our work. <br>

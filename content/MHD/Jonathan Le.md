My approach is to work on ways to change your thoughts, ways to be mindful of triggers, stimuli or outside factors that contribute to negative thinking and negative behaviors . I have worked on a vast amount of different concerns such as phobias, anxiety, or depressive symptoms and many other mental health concerns as well.

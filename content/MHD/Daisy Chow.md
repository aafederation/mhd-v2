I am a mental health counselor and I am licensed to practice in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Texas. My strengths are helping clients with histories of various trauma, including attachment ruptures, abandonment, early childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect. I am trained in Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) which is an evidence-based treatment approach for PTSD and has been beneficial in relieving symptoms of depression, anxiety, grief and loss. I also have a passion in working with therapists, teachers, doctors and clients in other professional fields who struggle with burnout and compassion fatigue.   
  
   
  
My therapeutic approach is to provide support and practical feedback to help clients effectively address personal life challenges. I integrate complementary methodologies and techniques to offer a highly personalized approach tailored to each client. With compassion and understanding, I work with each individual to help them build on their strengths and attain the personal growth they are committed to accomplishing.​​

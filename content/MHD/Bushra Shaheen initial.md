Hi! I'm Bushra (she/her/hers). I am a trauma-informed therapist who has worked with a myriad of clients, including adolescents and immigrant women of South Asian descent. I work with clients to offer support in processing and coping with trauma-related events, including domestic violence, sexual assault, forced marriage, managing cultural expectations, acculturation, body image issues, as well as mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression. I center an anti-oppressive, holistic, feminist, and intersectional approach. I am passionate about social justice and creating a safer, equitable, and inclusive future. I recognize that agency and resiliency are connected to a clientâ€™s multitude of identities and work collaboratively with clients to nurture a safe space that serves as a catalyst for healing. I'm glad you're on the journey toward better mental health and I would be honored to embark on this journey with you. I currently offer remote tele-therapy sessions. Please feel free to reach out for a consultation.

Hi! I am the Clinical Director and Founder of Woodrose Counseling. I am a multilingual licensed mental health counselor fluent in Gujarati and second generation South Asian American. My experience working with adults from diverse backgrounds and age groups in community-based and outpatient settings informs my culturally sensitive approach. I also offer a therapeutic modality called Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP) as a complement to psychotherapy for those who are interested and eligible.

I believe that therapy is an opportunity to explore our struggles in the context of our past experiences and patterns while in a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental space and developing more effective ways of navigating them. My philosophy is that therapy is a collaborative place for finding support in healing, developing self-awareness and working towards your goals. I utilize an eclectic approach drawing from psychodynamic, person-centered, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

I am a licensed clinical psychologist with years of experience in various settings, including university counseling centers (Baruch, NYU, Fordham), a psychiatric in-patient unit, a community outpatient clinic, and a rehabilitation hospital. I have an extensive experience working with young adults and adults coping with a wide range of mental disorders and life stressors (e.g., depression; anxiety; trauma; adjustment issues; acculturation issues; interpersonal difficulties; racial trauma).

I utilize an integrative approach that synthesizes elements from various therapy models (e.g., psychodynamic, CBT, DBT). Through this approach, I will support you in gaining new insights and meanings, building new skills, recognizing your incredible resilience, and breaking free from unhelpful patterns that may be holding you back.

In our therapeutic journey together, my primary aim is to establish a profound sense of connection with you. Using this therapeutic alliance, I will gently yet firmly encourage you to confront your challenges, facilitating new experiences and understanding.

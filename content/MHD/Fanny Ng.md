I am a NY state licensed clinical psychologist who works with adults in the treatment of anxiety, depression, grief, and trauma. I practice from a feminist multicultural perspective that is LGBTQIA+ affirming. I also specialize in helping folks to address issues related to identity, race, culture, gender, work, and family as well as manage sleep disorders, chronic pain, cancer, and other health issues.

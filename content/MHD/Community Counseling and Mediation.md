CCM’s staff offers innovative, culturally sensitive treatment at four NYS-licensed mental health clinics in Brooklyn and midtown Manhattan. Our clinics offer individual, group and family counseling; psychological, psychiatric, and psychosocial assessment and diagnosis; and psychopharmacology. Workshops on domestic violence, anger management, and parenting skills are also provided. We work on a case-by-case basis that is sensitive not only to cultural differences but also to the uniqueness of the individual and his or her problems.

<br>

CCM’s strong commitment to a high level of professional service, diversity, and connection to Asia, started over 35 years ago. The outpatient Asian Clinic Treatment Services (ACTS) at CCM Clinics provides culturally sensitive and inclusive and supportive mental health services including individual therapy, family therapy, and group therapy, and case management services to Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, and other Asian communities. Recognizing that cultural factors have a direct influence in the way an individual views the causality and treatment of mental illness, our program encourages our clients and their family to work within their cultural framework, maximize successful treatment outcomes, and prevent relapse. Attuned to cultural influences on psychiatric presentations, our skilled clinicians produce through diagnostic assessments while delivering in culturally sensitive ways.

Asmi Shah is a sound healer, yoga asana and meditation teacher, and pranic healer based out of Brooklyn, NY.   Asmi  grew up in an Indian household exposed to ancient Indian traditions and rituals.  They were always a part of her life, but they took on a greater role as she found herself burnt out from work and personal challenges.  Asmi got into yoga as a way to feel healthier and more connected to her body.  She truly believes these tools are for everyone and can significantly improve quality of life.

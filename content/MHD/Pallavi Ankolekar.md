Life, at times, can feel heavy and I am here to lessen that load. You don't need to carry the burden of your struggles and experiences alone. It could be challenging to find a space to open up about all the different areas in your life that make you who you are, past and present, and look forward to what you want in the future. Whether you are experiencing anxiety, depression, symptoms of trauma, 1st gen family and cultural conflicts, coping with life transitions, relationship issues, identifying and setting healthy boundaries, or the myriad challenges that can arise, I am here to support and help you reach your highest potential!

<br>

As a 1.5 generation immigrant, I am passionate about helping BIPOC, especially millennials, navigate their journey with warmth and compassion. Through my extensive training in trauma and EMDR within a culturally sensitive and anti-racist approach, together we can process unresolved issues because we all deserve the opportunity to thrive and not just survive.

<br>

It can be difficult to identify our strengths when faced with obstacles and sometimes we need someone to believe in us when we don't believe in ourselves. I firmly have faith in a personâ€™s capacity for change and I provide a warm, accepting, and welcoming environment to facilitate your growth within. I want you to leave feeling lighter and breathing easier.

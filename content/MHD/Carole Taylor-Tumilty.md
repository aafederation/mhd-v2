I am a licensed clinical social worker who works with people in New York City and throughout New York state. I specialize in working with individuals including female identifying clients, members of the Asian American community, and mixed-race individuals who would like to explore and heal from trauma. <br>
Whether you’re grappling with questions about career, relationships, race, identity, spirituality, or beyond, I provide a safe, non-judgmental space to collaboratively explore your present-day concerns. We’ll also explore how your past informs your responses and reactions to what is happening to you in your day-to-day life. <br>
My therapeutic approach draws from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), psychodynamic theory, and elements including mindfulness, grounding techniques, and gratitude therapy. <br>

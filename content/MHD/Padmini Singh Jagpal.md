As an Indo-Caribbean-American mental health counselor, I bring a deep understanding and empathy to those grappling with mental health challenges. I know firsthand the cultural stigmas that often accompany these struggles. Growing up in a Guyanese household where emotions weren't openly discussed, I've experienced feelings of being misunderstood or ostracized after being vulnerable. I want you to know that I recognize these unique experiences and identities that shape our mental health perspectives.

My therapeutic approach incorporates a multicultural lens, using evidence-based practices such as mindfulness, person-centered therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. I create a safe and inclusive space that respects your values and beliefs. Whether you're navigating a mental health condition, seeking to improve relationships, or working through past traumas, I am here to support you.

You can expect a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your thoughts and feelings in our sessions. I'm passionate about helping you develop self-awareness and cultivate mindfulness in your everyday life. By nurturing these skills, we can foster inner peace and better equip you to manage difficult emotions.

I'm particularly aware of the harmful narratives that can affect our lives—like feeling shamed for being vulnerable or gaslighting ourselves into thinking our problems don't exist. I want to challenge these perspectives. I aim to deconstruct the stigmas surrounding mental health, encouraging you to see your feelings as strengths, not signs of weakness or immaturity

Building trust with you is a process I respect. I want to earn your trust, not demand it. And as we journey together, I'll remind you that having these feelings does not make you 'different' or inferior. It's okay to cry; it's okay to feel.

I invite you to take a brave step towards your well-being. I offer a 15-minute consultation to determine if we're a good fit for each other. You're free to reach out to me at [psinghjagpal@lotusoasisllc.com](mailto:psinghjagpal@lotusoasisllc.com) to start your healing journey. Together, we can foster healing, mindfulness, and self-awareness.

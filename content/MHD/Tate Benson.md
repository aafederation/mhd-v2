As a mixed-race Korean, queer, trans, and non-binary person, I witness and experience the impact systemic oppression has on our ability to build interdependent relationships and communities. So for over ten years, I have built opportunities for folks of various identities to be joyful, playful, creative, and at ease in our bodies. As a therapist, I focus on providing spaces to open up and examine what has worked, what no longer works, and what could work in the future. We all develop strategies to survive and live in this world, but I firmly believe examining all the pieces we bring to the table can help us open up new possibilities and pathways for not just surviving, but thriving.

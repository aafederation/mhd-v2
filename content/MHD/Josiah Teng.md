I work with adolescents, young adults, and families to navigate issues of anxiety and depression, life transitions, family and relationship conflict, trauma and identity, emotional intimacy and substance and recovery.   
My approach to therapy is rooted in psychodynamic, person-centered, family systems models. In applying a humanistic lens, I provide an empowering space for vulnerability and self-exploration and consider the functioning of an individual within the context of their environment. I also implement techniques from evidence-based interventions such as CBT and DBT to help individuals confidently navigate life stressors.

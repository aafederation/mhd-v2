My name is River 瑩瑩 Dandelion, and I am a Reiki energy healing practitioner, attuned to the highest level of Usui Reiki. As a Reiki Master, my wellness practice is a unique blend of my certifications and studies in Usui Reiki Ryoho, shamanism, and herbalism. My expertise lives in helping clients move through anxiety, self-doubt, self-judgement, major life transitions, and deep inner transformations. I specialize in working with Asian, queer, trans, immigrant, and people of the global majority, and I am fluent in three languages of Chinese: Toisanese, Cantonese, and Mandarin, alongside Spanish and English. <br>
I am a queer and trans, Toisanese keeper of ancestral medicine through energy healing, teaching, writing poetry, and creating ceremony. As a former grassroots organizer, I am a politicized healer connected to the social movements of our times. I also am an abolitionist who provides anti-racist, gender-affirming care to my highest capacity. <br>
I have devoted my life to fortifying intuition, self-love, self-trust, and claiming inner power. I am here to support you to move in the same, on your own unique journey. I, and my communities, thrive when you dream bigger and take concrete action to claim what your ancestors dreamed for you. <br>
As a Reiki practitioner, I am also an educator who has facilitated healing arts workshops, trainings, and clinics at Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health, Restorative Justice Initiative, and Alliance for Quality Education, among other organizations. My work melds at the intersections of arts, education, healing, towards liberation. <br>

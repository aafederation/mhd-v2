Hi. I’m Jinal Mehta. I’m a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist board-certified in the state of New York. More specifically I am someone who sparks change in people’s lives and relationships. I help individuals and couples who want to feel satisfied in their connection with their partner but feel like no matter what they do it just leads to stress and frustration.

I work with individuals and couples on enhancing relationships with one's self and with others. I create a warm and collaborative environment in order to foster insight and awareness. I specialize in relationship concerns including: creating and maintaining satisfying interpersonal relationships, coping with feelings that arise from the ending of relationship; Parenting struggles and healing from divorce.

The most important relationship is with yourself. An unhealthy relationship with yourself can manifest as depression, anxiety, lack of impulse control, self-loathing, unhealthy relationship with food, poor body image and eating disorders. When suffering from any of these issues it is difficult to feel satisfied in our relationships.

I will work with you to help alleviate the pain that arises from such issues in order to develop new and healthy ways of relating to yourself and others.

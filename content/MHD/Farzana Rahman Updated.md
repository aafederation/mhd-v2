As a therapist, I strive to create a space that is warm, accepting, and trauma informed. We can work together to help you gain insight and flourish within your relationships, while learning to remain connected to yourself. Therapy is your space to feel vulnerable and express the more difficult emotions without judgement. I am fascinated by how our family relationships can impact other relationships, our self worth, and our place in the world. I work most well with clients who are curious towards their past experiences and I can support them in understanding the impact of those. I do not believe that therapy can be a "cure" for current struggles, rather it can be insightful and healing. I have additional training in attachment-based interventions to better understand family dynamics, adverse childhood experiences, and relationships.

When people experience seasons of struggle, as we all undoubtedly do, sometimes therapy can be a valuable resource to help us find clarity, navigate uncertainty, lean into change and growth, or rediscover and restore what we once knew about ourselves. My philosophy in terms of treatment is one of partnership. I aspire to create a space, where you can feel safe to be vulnerably seen and heard, and my hope is that, at the end of our time together, you will feel empowered to live your life to the fullest, equipped with a diverse array of coping tools that you can confidently call your own. <br>
Starting with a personalized treatment plan, we will work together to better understand your symptoms and to outline your goals for therapy - what it means for therapy to be helpful for you. In our sessions, we will build on your strengths and face your fears together so that youâ€™re better able to meet times of struggle and doubt with greater resilience. <br>
At Realize B Therapy & Consulting, my therapeutic modalities include: Problem Solving Treatment (PST), Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), Behavioral Activation, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Complicated Grief Treatment, Motivational Interviewing, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Therapy.

Greetings, I'm Kaira Otero, and I'm thrilled to connect with you. As someone who's half Filipino and half Puerto Rican, my heart is deeply invested in supporting BIPOC individuals and the adult children of immigrants. My focus revolves around guiding people through inner-child work and healing unresolved childhood traumas.

What drives my passion is helping individuals embrace their shadowsâ€”the parts often hidden or overlooked. I believe that understanding and accepting these aspects of ourselves empower us to show up authentically in the world. My mission is to help you tap into your inner strength and recognize the incredible power you hold within.

In my practice, I also serve as a psychedelic guide and therapist, weaving in ketamine-assisted psychotherapy. I strive to create a warm, inclusive space where you can explore, heal, and grow. Together, we'll journey toward a deeper understanding of yourself, empowering you to embrace your authenticity and live more fully.

Fullchange Therapy uses an equity-based "Pay What It's Worth" model. That is, clients pay for sessions in the amount that they believe sessions are worth. 50-minute sessions are worth $225 each. However, ultimately the client decides the fee. A portion of fees goes towards free or subsidized mental health services for historically marginalized communities.  
See www.drfullchange.com/fees for more details. 
Fullchange Therapy can provide out-of-network paperwork for your insurance company to reimburse you for "out-of-network mental health services," if provided by your insurance company."""

I'm a licensed psychotherapist in NYC and have 24 years of clinical experience.   I currently work with individual adults for various issues such as depression, anxiety, relationship and family related issues.  I have extensive experiences working in variety of settings with diverse populations.  This includes community- and hospital-based mental health environments and working with children, adolescents and families.

I have given numerous educational workshops on different mental health topics such as depression, anxiety and trauma in the New York Public Library, senior centers and schools and at community-organized events.  I have been interviewed by the BBC and for a Voice of America television program, as well as for other radio programs on mental health issues.

I’m a certified EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapist. I’m also trained in Somatic Intervention and other somatic related therapies.  I now provide a leading edge therapy Ketamine-Assisted- Psychotherapy for traditionally challenging issues.

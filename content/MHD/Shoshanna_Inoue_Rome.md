I am a New York State licensed mental health counselor. As a Japanese American who grew up in Japan, Iâ€™m committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. I offer virtual sessions and have limited in-person hours at my office in Hastings-On-Hudson. I provide caring and compassionate psychotherapy specializing in perinatal mental health, maternal mental health, anxiety, depression, trauma, mood disorders, and issues surrounding racial and identity.

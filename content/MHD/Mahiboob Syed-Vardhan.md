I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in New York State with approximately twenty plus years of experience in working with multicultural individuals dealing with wide range of challenges.  I am passionate about helping others become the best version of who they are meant to be.

I specialize in working with adolescents (age 10-19), and adults. I work with individuals, couples and families focusing on mending relationships, stress, anxiety, and depression. I believe every individual is unique, so I tailor my person-centered approach from a variety of modalities, including, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Holistic and Person-Centered approach. I like to focus more on the present and help you be able to move forward to a better, happier and healthier life.

I have extensive experience with working with individuals of all different ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds. Coming from a multicultural background I pay special attention to the cultural context. I am especially passionate about working with clients from culturally diverse backgrounds, and providing linguistically sensitive, culturally appropriate, and multicultural focused treatments tailored to your background and presenting concerns.

I am a strong believer in positive thinking.  With lots of empathy and dash of humor, I can help you overcome anything!

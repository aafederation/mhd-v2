My primary focus in our work is attunement â€” to sense and respond to you through the work, bring curiosity to the present moment, find language for your inner worlds, and create space for the many parts of you. I work in collaboration with clients around issues regarding relationships and partnerships, codependency, identity, past trauma, self-esteem/self-confidence, and life transitions. <br>
As a second-generation Korean American therapist, I am attuned to the delicate web of intergenerational, multicultural dynamics experienced by many 1.5 and 2nd generation Asian Americans. I attend to dynamics of power and oppression, marginalization and privilege, belonging and intersectionality throughout my work. <br>

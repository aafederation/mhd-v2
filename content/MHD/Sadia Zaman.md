As a first generation woman of South Asian parents, I was raised in London and spent most of my adult life in the U.S. I bring an open mind and a perspective that embraces the nuances of our emotional and mental health. <br>
Sometimes it's difficult to know the full extent of the way our trauma and life experiences have impacted us. We find ourselves repeating certain patterns that we know are not good for us and can't seem to break the chain, we constantly fall into moods and feelings that it's difficult to pull ourselves out of. In deciding to do therapy with me, together we learn how to identify the ways in which your past trauma and life experiences show up in your adult life and begin rewriting your narrative for your future. <br>
My job is to be with you as you embark on this journey of self healing and discovery. I see myself in the passenger seat navigating us to your goals. I bring transparency and authenticity to the therapeutic alliance and hold space for you to bring whatever feels safe and comfortable. I engage in the process with you from the beginning to the very end. <br>

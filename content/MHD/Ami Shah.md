Hello, I’m Dr. Shah! <br>
The goal in therapy is for you to become the best version of yourself. My clinical specialties include working with adult and older adult clients with anxiety, depression, East and South Asian intergenerational trauma, grief and loss, anger and stress management, relationship stress, and support for caregivers of loved ones with dementia. I enjoy use of  Western and Eastern medicine in the therapeutic process. Additionally, I am passionate about exploring and treating unique stressors associated with late-life to promote positive aging in our community.   <br>
Please email me if you are interested in scheduling a 15-minute complimentary phone/video consultation.

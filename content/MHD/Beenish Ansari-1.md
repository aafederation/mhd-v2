As a first-generation child of two parents who immigrated from Pakistan, I recognize the challenges and barriers placed upon a community that lacked access to mental health resources. Resources that could have changed the outcome of their own lives. Having experience working with teens, young adults, families, and parents I understand that therapy is not a one size fits all guide. I work to tailor sessions based on the client's needs while creating a warm and welcoming environment. I strongly believe in the power of the therapeutic process and strive to create a safe and empowering space that encourages clients to develop trust, share and process their vulnerabilities and traumas, and achieve lifelong growth. I believe in the importance of a collaborative process and that clients are the authors of their lives. My hope is to guide you along this path with genuine empathy, empowerment, humor, and some tough love along the way. Utilizing a client-centered, strength-based approach with Cognitive Behavioral Techniques, Attachment Theory, and a Trauma Focused lens, I work to support clients in sharing vulnerabilities and past traumas.   
I have experience working with clients who have anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADHD, life transitions, relationship challenges, communication struggles, parental/child issues, and everyday life stressors. As a certified yoga teacher, I frequently utilize mindfulness and meditation techniques throughout sessions to support you in achieving stability throughout treatment. Showing up is the hardest part and it would be my privilege to walk alongside you throughout this journey of self-reflection and growth.

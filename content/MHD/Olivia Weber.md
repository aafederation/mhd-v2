My approach is taken from training in Transpersonal and contemplative buddhist psychology at Naropa University. The root teaching is the notion of “Brilliant Sanity”. This means that we all have within us a natural dignity and wisdom. Our basic nature is covered over like a butterfly in a cocoon, but nonetheless, it is within us and can be cultivated through mindfulness awareness, acceptance and self love. As a practitioner I seek to assist my clients to begin to shed their layers of the their cocoon, and accept themselves as whole people. I utilize mindfulness techniques, somatic awareness, meditation, attachment and experiential experiments. I encourage clients to stay with their feelings in the here and now accept and honor the present moment with all its feelings rather than exiling or fixing their feelings. 

I am also a Licensed Creative Arts Therapist and Board Certified Art Therapist. Many adults struggle to put words to their experiences and using art making as a container to explore feelings that are not fully captured by words can be extremely validating. You don't have to consider yourself an artist to participate in art therapy, all it requires is the willingness to be open. Art can be a safe therapeutic space to examine and explore your emotions without words. My techniques are experiential, warm, and full of nuance, playing with shapes, colors and endless possibility using metaphors. You will come to learn that it is not in the product of art making that you will find answers, but the answer lie in the in the process of staying in the unknown and following your inner knowing and inner voice.

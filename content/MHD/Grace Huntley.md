As a mental health counselor, I provide the time and space for people to tell, understand, and learn from their stories and experiences. 

I work with a variety of clients and topics but have the most experience working with college students and young professionals. 

I help my clients navigate life transitions, identify and overcome negative patterns, and gain the skills and confidence they need to find better solutions. Areas of specialty are career and transitions, emerging adulthood, adoption, anxiety, depression, romantic obstacles, and trauma.

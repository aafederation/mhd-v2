The goal of therapy is to alleviate psychological pain and suffering, but beyond this, I have learned over the course of my 20-year career as a psychotherapist that everyone has the capacity to change, grow, and attain a creative, fulfilling life. I work from a holistic perspective of body, emotion, thought, and energy so that one can arrive at genuine self-acceptance, healing, and growth. I value inclusiveness and welcome individuals with intersectional identities of race, family/ethnic heritage, class, religion/spirituality, health/disabilities, age, gender, and sexual orientation. I bring deep appreciation for how these identities influence our perception of ourselves, how we relate to others, and how we navigate the broader world. My personal immigration experience and bicultural background as an Asian-American has given me a keen understanding of the challenges of being the “other” and navigating the complexities of integrating the various identities we hold. I have expertise and passion in helping individuals with bicultural backgrounds who are exploring their authentic way of being as they negotiate and integrate progressive values/beliefs with those of their cultural heritage. I offer compassionate guidance for my clients in a collaborative, interactive, and reflective therapeutic space.

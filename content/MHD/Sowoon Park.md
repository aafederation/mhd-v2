It often feels like we live in a fast-paced world where our identities are reduced to our “productivity.” It’s understandable that you may have begun to doubt yourself and neglect your physical and emotional needs. However, we can challenge those negative thoughts to reshape our emotions and behaviors, which can improve our view of self and the quality of our interpersonal relationships. 

With advanced clinical training in health, mental health, and disabilities at Columbia University, I have collaborated with a wide range of populations in diverse neighborhoods. I have worked in schools and multiple healthcare settings. I am well-versed in providing care to individuals with a variety of chronic illnesses and mental health concerns.

My practice is rooted in a strength-based perspective and I believe in treating individuals with respect and equity. I ensure to incorporate personalized plans and styles with the individual. I am passionate about supporting one’s unique intersecting identities in race, ethnicity, class, gender, sex, sexuality, religion, etc.

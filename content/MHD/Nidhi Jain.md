I'm Nidhi Jain, a breathwork, meditation and pilates instructor in Brooklyn, NY, on land of the Munsee Lenape people. My style is rooted in the seasons, lunar cycle, elements, and ancestors.

I love dance and singing and believe creativity is an incredible force for change, internal and external.

I believe embodiment practices are fundamental to building the compassionate inclusive world I dream of, because they allow each of us to get to the rootâ€”dismantling internalized racism, patriarchy, colonialism, transphobia, and all separation. This deep healing allows us to sustain through the complex, systemic work needed to create a just, free society.

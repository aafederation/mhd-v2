Charlie’s Focus  
Charlie’s areas of focus include queer affirmation, coming out, sex, relationships (monogamy, polyamory, and consensual non-monogamy), racial identity, whiteness, self-esteem, and grief.

  
Charlie’s Philosophy  
Charlie believes that the systems we navigate directly impact our mental health and well-being, and that through recognition and critical consciousness of these influences, we can radically free ourselves.   
Charlie’s philosophy borrows from Freirean thought and the belief that individuals are masters of their own experiences; that collaboratively, we will liberate each other.

  
Charlie’s Approach  
Charlie’s approach to therapy is multicultural, feminist, trauma-informed, and liberatory. Eclectic in nature, he borrows from therapeutic modalities as they best suit each individual client. He folds in elements from psychodynamic practices, DBT, positive psychology, existentialist works, and participatory methods. Charlie is nonjudgmental and collaborative.  
Among other things, Charlie examines two major themes in therapy: our uniquely intersectional identities and the systems that we navigate as result. He believes therapy can be moldable while challenging oppressive systems and the status quo.

  
More about Charlie  
Charlie works at a lab researching minority stress theory. He currently volunteers for the Trevor project.  
Charlie speaks Mandarin and Japanese. In his free time, he sings, moves heavy things around, and makes art.

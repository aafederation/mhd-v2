Hi, I'm Su. I am a social worker in New York State. At the base of my work is a sense of compassionate curiosity, a genuine wonder: I seek to delve ever deeper into my clients' distinctive lived experiences and the myriad of potential pathways open to them. While I draw from a wide range of therapeutic modalities based on individual client needs, I think of therapy primarily as a place for play. To play doesnâ€™t mean to take matters lightly. For most animals, including us humans, playing is serious business. During play, we observe, practice, and rehearse.

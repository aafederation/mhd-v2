We are living a life where we always have to be “on.” Life is nonstop, whatever the focus is – work, family, home. You are anxious constantly and feeling overwhelmed daily. You are the person everyone goes to for support but now it’s time to focus on you. Therapy is a space for you to put a stop to the nonstop. Every individual deserves to have a therapeutic space to unpack some of the baggage that is weighing on him/her/them. As sessions progress, you will feel equipped in managing your hectic days as well as build skills and insight towards what may have been holding you back from living the life you want to live.  
  
I have experience working with both adults and young adults in navigating periods of transition, life changes and relationships. Oftentimes along with change comes complicated feelings of stress, grief and loss. I hold space for you to slow down, heal and rebuild. I utilize therapeutic interventions along the way that assist you in finding a way forward.  
  
I understand and recognize that therapy is not one-size-fits-all. I will collaborate with you to create a space where we can work together to better understand you. I look forward to unpacking this baggage with you in a safe, supportive place. No worries – There is room for it all. Reach out and we can take this next step together.

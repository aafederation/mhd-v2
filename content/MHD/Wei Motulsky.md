Please note that I am cash pay only for clients in New York State.\ <br>
I approach therapy using psychodynamic, psychoanalytic, and feminist lenses. I believe that therapy is most effective and meaningful when done collaboratively and hope to work together to understand how your past relationships and experiences shape who you are today. In particular, I wish to explore how your past influences your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors- all within your sociopolitical context. <br>
I have formal training in working with queer individuals, people of color, and those who are survivors of trauma and interpersonal violence. It is my firm belief that you are the expert in the room and that it is my role to support you in finding a more authentic way to live your life and express your feelings, needs, and desires. <br>

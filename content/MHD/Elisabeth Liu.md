I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) committed to understanding the impact of loss and trauma when treating children, families and individuals. I hold a Bachelor’s degree from Fordham University and a Master’s degree from Rutgers University, where I focused my studies on violence against women and children. I have worked in a variety of settings including residential substance abuse programs, harm-reduction clinics, and large non-profits in addition to private practice. Nice to meet you!

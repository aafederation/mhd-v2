Michelle Shinagawa is a Reiki Master/teacher and a coach and she helps people Be Grounded, Centered, Connected, and live life that sparks joy.
She offers private Reiki sessions and Reiki classes, Reiki is a Japanese energy healing modality.
In her private session, she helps her clients release negative beliefs, negative energy, and anything that’s not serving them anymore. Some of my clients release issues they have been carrying for around 20-30 years in one session. 
In her Reiki class, she teaches tools to be centered, grounded, and connected. The main focus is on Self-care. Many of us are running around with empty fuel being exhausted. She teaches some Reiki techniques to release anxiety to enjoy the peaceful mind and pump up the energy.

Are you feeling stuck in life? Hi! I'm Jin-Hee, and I've been a social worker and therapist for the past twenty years. My focus in my work is with women, in all stages and circumstances in life struggling with the feeling of being stuck.  It is my passion and mission to help uncover the places where we have gotten stuck, the family bonds and intergenerational and cross cultural factors keep us stuck.  And then to help create a cohesive sense of identity that we then use to envision what life might look like on the other side of stuck.. and most importantly, I will work with you to get you there. To a place with more peace, less stress.

So how do we get there and how does the magic happen? I use a blend of traditional talk therapy (CBT focused) to understand how we got here, life coaching to plan out the steps to get us unstuck, and mindset management to uncover and harness the power and wisdom that you already have and use that to get you to your goals. 

Together with me as your coach and therapist we can define what it means, to you, to have a happy, fulfilled and authentic life, and I am here to support you on that journey.

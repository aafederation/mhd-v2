I am originally from Fuzhou China. I came to the Florida when I was 9. From there, i joint the US navy for 7 year. I found my passion in holistic health and wellness in 2015. My focus is to guide people to connect to their own wisdom inside of them. 

I offer enneagram coaching. This is for anyone whoâ€™s looking to understand themselves better and cultivate a deeper and more fulfilling relationship with themselves and others. 

I also focus on using an holistic approach to help people get out of pain and lose weight without relying on meds, injections, surgeries or crash diets. 

I specialize in using ELDOA spinal decompression therapy to teach people how they can create space in their joint so they can help themselves get out of chronic pain. 

My aim is to help people connect to their body to understand what they need in terms of nutrition, hydration, sleep and movement. 

I also teach people how to breath better to reduce stress, have more energy, digest better and sleep better. Breath is life. And 9/10 people does not breathe well. 

I believe health is a combination of thinking well, feeling well and moving well. 

My goal is to help others connect to their mind, body and heart in order to live the life they want.

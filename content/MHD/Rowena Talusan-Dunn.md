Rowena Talusan-Dunn is a Registered Art Therapist and Licensed Creative Art Therapist in Westchester, New York. She specializes in womenâ€™s issues, young professionals or young adults who are still in graduate school. Additionally, she sees parents of children with Autism, as well as children who have been diagnosed on the Autism Spectrum disorder. Dr. Talusan-Dunn also specializes in anxiety, depression, career counseling, stress management and relationship issues.

Dr. Talusan-Dunn enjoys helping clients focus on self care and relaxation through the multi-sensory experience of art making. This often proves empowering for clients to discover a new language and mode in their own recovery and progress.

When working with children who have autism, as well as those who have a loved one on the spectrum, Dr. Talusan-Dunn offers a creative arts approach. She takes a relaxed philosophy to this modality, and considers it an exploratory process that is less inhibited. She always keeps a close pulse on what her clients feel comfortable with. Additionally, she offers group therapy for families and children with autism.

For clients who are less interested in art, she also incorporates exercises from the skills-based treatment, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

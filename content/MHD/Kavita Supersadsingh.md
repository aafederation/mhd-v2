I believe that psychotherapy fosters the path towards wholeness and connection and I am committed to the healing process. Past hurts, societal and familial programming, the voice of the inner critic, emotional dysregulation, and traumatic experiences can fragment self and break away our inner strengths and resources. I aim to relocate those strengths and inner resiliencies by facilitating connection, exploration, and implementing appropriate best-practice tools. My aim is to navigate the psychological barriers that create disconnection and establish new patterns.

I believe we must learn to overcome the challenges that are thrown at each of us while examining & understanding our own patterns & defenses. I will help you face current life stressors or confront past trauma so that you may begin living more fully in the present. I use a combination of modalities & techniques such as CBT, Trauma Informed Care & Mindfulness <br>
I work with issues related to Work/School Life Stressors, Depression & Anxiety, Substance Abuse, Addiction, OCD, Acculturation, Cross Cultural Issues, Biculturalism, Life & Career Transitions, Low Self-Esteem, Personal Growth, Panic Attacks, Trauma, Abuse, Domestic Violence, Grief & Loss, Relationship Conflicts, Stress Management, Mood & Eating Disorders.

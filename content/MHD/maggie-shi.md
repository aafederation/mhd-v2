I view each client as an individual, tailoring sessions to incorporate their unique strengths and desires. My style is a mix of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques with psychodynamic, mindfulness, and person-centered methods to reduce depression, anxiety, and stress and address relationship issues, life transitions, and self-esteem. I work with clients to make lasting change by increasing insight and addressing underlying issues that are the source of their distress.   
  
Prior to becoming a psychotherapist, I was a lifestyle writer and editor and completed a culinary degree. I received my BA from Princeton University and my MA from New York University.

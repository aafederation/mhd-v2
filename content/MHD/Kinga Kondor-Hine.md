My work in the field of counseling began in 1992 and I have been a clinician in practice for over 25 years. I specialize in helping clients work through trauma, depression, anxiety, grief and loss, and supporting them on their journey to improved balance in life. My therapeutic approach is person centered. I work closely with clients to help them connect with their values, gain personal insight, understanding and self-compassion. With a trauma-informed mindset, I strive to create a safe and therapeutic environment. This entails a blend of treatment interventions designed to best match individual needs. I draw inspiration from the work of colleagues like: Brene Brown, Bessel Van der Kolk, Gabor Mate, Alfred Adler, Carl Rogers, and Carl Jung. These individuals are leaders in the field of counseling and therapy. They are the inspiration that has helped build my foundation for an enduring and balanced practice. <br>
My counseling background includes work with adults, college students, children and families, couples, Military Personnel, Veterans, and their families, as well as disabled adults. In my current work, I focus on helping individuals rebuild a foundation from which to grow from. Because I am a firm believer in the power of yoga, self-reflection, and meditation; when appropriate, I weave Eastern Philosophies into treatment. For example, the body holds trauma in seven main body parts (pelvis, diaphragm, throat, jaw,hamstrings, shoulders, and neck). With the application of some yoga, meditation, and mindful attention, we can help the body release underlying trapped feelings so that healing can begin. <br>

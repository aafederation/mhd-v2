I, Diana Chen, PhD, am a clinical psychologist working in a private practice in Manhattan. I believe we all the power to transform life's challenges and difficulties into opportunities for healing. I offer a warm accepting environment that allows people to voice their thoughts and feelings openly without fear of disapproval or rejection.

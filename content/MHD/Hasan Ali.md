The only way to change is to define who you are and then change your habits to align with who your new self is. It's as simple as that, but the problem that arises the most with the clients who come into my office is; who is this new person I want to be. This can be difficult, because many times there are many underlying factors that prevent us, or that we perceive prevent us from taking the steps we need to move forward. It is my job to help you realize what great potential you have inside you already. With that said, letâ€™s work together to pick apart the old ideas you have of yourself, and create a new pathway forward.


One of the primary functions of language, besides conveying information, is to motivate & influence each other's behavior. The focus on our sessions together are aimed at behavior and lifestyle change. To me, behavior encompasses all of human experience; so our focus will be to narrow down your understanding of how your behavior affects your concept of you.


I truly get that life is hard and be filled with disappointment but it is our collective duty and responsibility to not make life worse than it is. I will help you develop the focus you need to clear out the cobwebs from the past, and allow for more clarity in your ability to create a life for yourself that is worth living.

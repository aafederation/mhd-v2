I understand you might feel stuck in the past or the same negative loop and haven’t found any meaningful progress by talking to yourself, your family, or friends. My goal is not only to give you the tools to relieve your symptoms and better cope with specific situations but also to transform your narrative and generate sustainable growth. I use an integrative and tailored approach to meet your needs and cultural values. Combining systemic and relational framework, and mindfulness practice, I’ll help you gain insight into your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and align them to achieve what you most value in life.\
It is challenging to navigate our identities, including sexuality and relationship styles. I want to help you on your journey of self-discovery to become a powerful individual and build successful relationships with those around you. I am a 43-year-old female therapist with diverse experience in different careers, life transitions, and relationships.\
I have a background in finance and business and speak fluent English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. I’m confident my diverse background can provide a fresh perspective on your current issues. I serve individuals, teens, couples, and families in all shapes and forms with an open and welcoming mind. So, tell me your story, and I will meet you right where you are.

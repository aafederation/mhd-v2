We are a group of psychiatry and psychology providers who focus on holistic treatment in three elements. First, we emphasize the relationship with each individual in a therapeutic alliance, to recognize each individual’s unique strengths, goals, and needs. Second, good care is about integration. We have a diverse interdisciplinary team to address people’s needs beyond just medication management. We emphasize prevention and helping you reach your goals in life. And last, holistic care is about access, diversity and inclusivity

Have you been wrestling with waves of anxiety or depression, feeling disconnected, and feeling stuck in patterns that seem to repeat like obstacles blocking you from living the life you want? Maybe you’ve tried various means to push through, and maybe things feel okay until you are overtaken again with thoughts of self-criticism and doubt, leaving you feeling alone in your experience. You try to put your best foot forward but the effort feels exhausting as the cycle continues, and leave you feeling increasingly defeated and hopeless. <br>
What could life be like if you didn’t have to feel this way? If you could feel confident to be true to who you are without feeling shame or self-critical, to understand and connect with your authentic self. What if you could feel truly seen and heard in your relationships, and find clarity and motivation to pursue what feels right for you? <br>
The process can feel overwhelming, but you don’t have to do it alone. I am passionate about working with clients who are navigating these struggles, and have experience in providing therapy to help my clients gain a sense of control in their life. Using an integrative method, I prioritize supporting and guiding your therapy rather than dictating how it should go so that you can gain the tools necessary to navigate the challenges that come your way. Send me an email to book your consultation, or go to my website for more information to get started on your road to relief and empowerment. <br>

Beverly Liang, LMSW is a clinical social worker working out of Manhattan and virtually. She specializes in racial and ethnic identity development, Asian American identity, and immigrant/assimilation issues for adults. <br>
Beverly believes that it is through stories and language that we come to understand ourselves. Therapy allows for a rare space where together we come to listen and to be listened to, and to understand and evolve those stories. Over the course of a fifteen year long career in design and branding, Beverly became more interested in creating stories for people — not companies — and how these stories could change over time. <br>
Since training as a clinical social worker at the Silberman School of Social Work, Beverly has worked in diverse settings including outpatient community mental health clinics and older adult centers. <br>

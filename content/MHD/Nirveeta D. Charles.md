I enjoy working with first generation immigrants interested in exploring how their family of origin values and western culture plays a part in shaping their identity. I enjoy working with women who find themselves stepping out of boxes and breaking barriers set for them within their intimate relationships, families and society at large. I am also thoroughly delighted to join my clients on their journeys through recovery from religion.

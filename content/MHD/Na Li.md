I am a trilingual New York based Licensed Clinical Social Worker with a degree in Social Work from Columbia University. I have over 7 years of experience working with diverse populations of all backgrounds and ages, and I'm especially passionate about working with AAPI folks, first/second generation immigrants, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA communities. I specialize in anxiety, depression, racial and gender identity disparities, immigration, intergenerational trauma, and womenâ€™s issues.

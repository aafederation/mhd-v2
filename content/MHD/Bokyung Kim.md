As a queer, Korean therapist, I'm passionate about working with Asians and people of marginalized genders of the global majority. I want us to be free from the harms of oppressive systems, and find belonging and home in ourselves and relationships. My lens is relational, intersectional, trauma-informed, mindfulness-oriented, and anti-oppressive. I trust the wisdom of my clients' systems and lead with curiosity. I'm motivated to help clients feel more ease in their body, trust in their journey, and a sense of agency in activating life-affirming changes. 

<br>

I specialize in anxiety, depression, trauma, stress and coping, self-esteem, relationships, boundaries, healing from intergenerational trauma, intimate partner violence, sexual violence, grief and loss, identity issues and exploration, cultural issues for immigrants, and experiences of marginalization and oppression. 

<br>

I deeply value the relationships I have with clients. I don’t see them as transactional, but as a container for healing and a space to be our authentic, human selves. I’m committed to being authentic, transparent, collaborative, compassionate, accountable, and present with you. I will be alongside you on the brave journey towards self-discovery.

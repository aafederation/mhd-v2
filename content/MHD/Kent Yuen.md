My goal in working with clients is to help them live the life they want. I believe in providing a safe and supportive environment for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings. Clients seek therapy for a variety of reasons and I work hard to provide a safe, non judgemental space.

I use my training in relational psychoanalysis as well as my own experiences in working with clients to explore, reflect and discuss their needs and goals.

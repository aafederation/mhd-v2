I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker with over 15 years of clinical experience in mental health. I have treated people with depression, anxiety, grief, crisis management and other mental health concerns. Through the integration of cognitive behavioral therapy, coaching, mindfulness, motivational interviewing, narrative therapy, relational therapy, and solution-focused therapy, I have helped many of my clients find healing and rebuild their lives. I also have a special interest in working with couples and families in conflict to build meaningful relationships.

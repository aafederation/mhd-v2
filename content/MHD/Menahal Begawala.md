I’m Menahal, a licensed mental health counselor based in NYC. I’ve had the privilege of working with individuals, couples, and families to overcome a range of concerns including mental health struggles, rocky marriages, addictions, and trauma, to name a few. I believe that we all have exactly what we need to heal within us. This belief drives my work where I collaborate with my clients to uncover their innate ability to not only understand them, but also heal emotional wounding to create room for growth and thriving.

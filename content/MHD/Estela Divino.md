I am a licensed clinical social worker with over 30 years experience in various settings including long term care, palliative care and hospice, corporate consulting, and private-practice psychotherapy. Using mutually-agreed upon interventions and modalities to address depression, anxiety, self-esteem issues, stress-management, bereavement, life transitions, and adjustment, I believe we can work together to start and keep you on the road to a better state of mental wellness. I have extensive experience working with adults and seniors who are going through life changes, and the challenges they bring to their day-to-day lives. Together, using a growth mindset, we can develop strategies that will help you to heal and overcome what is holding you back from reaching your goals.

Facing life's challenges can be daunting, especially when we feel like we have to tackle them alone. Unfortunately, we don't always have a complete understanding of our emotions and may not have been taught effective coping mechanisms, resulting in hurt or confusion for ourselves or those around us. Taking the first step to seek help may be difficult, however, therapy offers a space of safety, learning, and personal development to become the individual you aspire to be. 


With over a decade of experience in the field, I have worked in various areas, ranging from depression and personality disorders to child development and end-of-life issues. I utilize an eclectic approach, allowing me to draw upon a diverse range of therapeutic techniques and strategies to address the specific needs and goals of each individual.

I am a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), which means I am a psychotherapist who received their education and clinical background with emphasis on looking at the entire person as a whole during treatment, not just focusing on treating a diagnosis. I received my Master’s from the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 2013. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of working with individuals who have trusted me to support and guide them through the difficulties life seems to throw their way. I love learning from my clients, laughing with them, and working together to see what changes we can start getting to work on.

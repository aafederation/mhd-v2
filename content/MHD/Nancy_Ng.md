I am a bilingual speaking clinical psychologist providing short-term and long-term psychotherapy. I specialize in treating general mental health concerns including anxiety, depression, and mood disorders. My approach is integrative drawing from psychodynamic theory, interpersonal skills, CBT and DBT.

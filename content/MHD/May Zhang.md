My name is May, a bilingual (English and Mandarin) therapist with 6+ years of experience who was born and raised in Shanghai. I came to the U.S. as a teen, and now I live in NYC. I have been a therapist for the past six years working with a variety of populations including children, adolescents, and adults with different needs and struggles in life.

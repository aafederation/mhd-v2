If you're feeling overwhelmed by anxiety, depression, grappling with grief, or carrying the weight of loneliness, guilt, or shame, know that you're not alone. Especially if you identify as Queer and/or BI/POC, navigating these emotions within cultural and familial dynamics can feel like an uphill journey. But you don't have to climb that mountain by yourself. I'm here to offer a warm and compassionate space where you can unpack your emotions without fear or judgment, process attachment and trauma experiences, and uncover patterns rooted in childhood. <br>
Working through the lens of attachment and Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, I support clients with navigating religious or attachment-based childhood trauma, cultural expectations (including around gender and sexuality), and ordinary day-to-day experiences. <br>
In our space, all parts of you - the anxious part, the perfectionist part, the inner child - are welcomed as they are. Together, we will connect with, be curious about, and get to know these parts with kindness and care. If youâ€™d like to learn more about how we can work together, please visit: www\.sayapsychotherapy.com

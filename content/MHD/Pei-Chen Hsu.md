I have more than 25 years of clinical experience helping people with depression, anxiety, trauma, low self-esteem, life-transition difficulties, family/relational problems, personality disorders, and grief and loss. I provide compassionate and evidence-based therapy. One hallmark of my practice is my commitment to creating a warm, non-judgmental, and empathic environment for my clients. I believe that everyone is fundamentally good, capable, and worthy. You can expect to be met with compassion, genuine connection, and respect throughout your therapeutic journey with me.

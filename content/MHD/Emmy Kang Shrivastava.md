Licensed therapist with a background in teaching and psychology, dedicated to healing and empowering individuals to navigate life's challenges and cultivate resilience. Specializing in trauma recovery, multicultural counseling, and EMDR therapy, I bring a unique perspective informed by my own experiences as an Asian American woman, working mother, and trauma survivor. I offer compassionate support and evidence-based interventions to address anxiety, depression, trauma, interpersonal issues, and identity exploration. My goal is to create a safe and inclusive space where clients feel heard, valued, and empowered to embark on a journey of healing and self-discovery.

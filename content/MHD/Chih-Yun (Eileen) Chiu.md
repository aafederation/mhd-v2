I am a work in progress and I am constantly striving to build a healthier relationship with myself and the world. If you relate, join me on an introspective journey and explore different aspects and dimensions of you that may long for more healing and nurturing, managing and tolerating, and challenging and advancing! I am enthusiastic, curious, creative, dependable, and compassionate. I value loyalty, kindness, enjoyment, connection, and openness. I have an international and multicultural personal and professional background. In addition to being a Bilingual Psychotherapist, I have held various roles as a leader, educator, self-starter and team-member. I have held interests in the Political Science field, including at the United Nations Department of Public Information and IMPACT Leadership 21. I learned about empowerment and advocacy for the underserved population through public policy. These experiences helped me learn and understand mental health from different lenses. In the Clinical and Counseling setting, I have worked in a Psychiatric Inpatient Unit, an Intensive Outpatient Program, and a Community Clinic. I work with adults, couples and families from all walks of life. Presently, my professional investment is in, among them, clients with challenges regarding anxiety, depression and grief; trauma; healthy lifestyle; racial and cultural identity; relationship and intimacy; and self-esteem / self-worth. My treatment approaches include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Mindfulness and Trauma-Focused), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Psychodynamic Therapy, Relational-Cultural Therapy, and Positive Psychotherapy. I also believe in using creative tools and interventions personalized to the clientâ€™s strengths, interests, desires and needs to help them help themselves.

At the center of my therapy practice is a safe, nonjudgemental, and supportive space for all clients.\ <br>
I aim to help clients meet their therapeutic goals by drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and person-centered lenses, with an emphasis on adapting to the needs of clients. My work is client-centered and interactive. I have experience in the higher education space and now focus my time in private practice. <br>
I studied mental health counseling at Columbia University and I completed my clinical graduate internship with Fordham University, where I helped students of all backgrounds with a variety of challenges such as career exploration, transitional stress, anxiety, to depression. As an Asian American and daughter of refugees, I hold an importance in shining light upon intersectional identities. I aim to bring space and awareness to identity exploration and approach my therapeutic work with a multicultural lens. <br>

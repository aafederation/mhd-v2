I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor serving the states of MA, NY, SC and FL. My approach is cognitive-behavioral, person-centered, strength-based, trauma-informed, and culturally sensitive. I'm passionate about collaborating with adults looking for support with mood or anxiety symptoms, health conditions, relationships, and various cultural or life adjustments.

As a blind Japanese immigrant, I work especially well with differently-abled people and Pan Asians. I have been trained in expressive arts therapy and am a certified gestalt therapist. I utilize the arts according to each personâ€™s abilities to imagine and develop body awareness. My eclectic approach suits people who seek to find themselves in mental health.

My fee is $255 per session. I offer reduced fees on a limited basis for individuals who cannot afford my full rate. You would pay me directly prior to the start of each session. I will give you a bill at the end of each month, and if you have insurance, you can then submit the bill to your insurance company for reimbursement directly to you.
I am New York State certified as eligible for insurance reimbursement; however, you should consult with your insurance company directly to determine your outpatient mental health benefits. If your insurance is managed care, you should inquire about out-of-network benefits, since I am not on managed care panels. Please note that Medicaid does not offer any out-of-network coverage.
I offer a free 15 minute phone consultation."""

I am a licensed clinical social worker offering psychotherapy and clinical supervision in NY, NE, FL, and NJ. I am a warm, attentive therapist who works with you to determine your individual goals and to move toward finding clarity, healing, and happiness.

My early career focused on working with LGBTQIA+ youth at The Trevor Project & The Ali Forney Center before transitioning to an outpatient hospital clinic for adolescents, adults, and seniors with HIV/AIDS. In addition to these areas, I specialize in working with depression, anxiety, grief, relational patterns, trauma, chronic illnesses including long covid, life changes, racial identity, and the autism spectrum.

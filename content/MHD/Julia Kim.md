안녕하세요! Hi, I'm Julia! I'm an Asian American therapist based in NYC! I hold years of experience successfully working with teens, adults, and young professionals who are struggling with relational issues (codependency & turbulent relational patterns), ADHD, understanding transgenerational trauma, family dynamics, cultural identity, depression, and anxiety. I utilize creative, holistic evidence-based psychotherapy to help people feel more whole, resilient and joyful. Working with me will be a creative collaboration with a goal of helping you heal and live in a way aligned with your needs, wants, and life goals. :-)

I truly believe that you have the capacity for resilience, change, and self-discovery. In sessions, I balance deep-listening with interventions rooted in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing, and holistic modalities such as guided imagery, meditation, breathwork & Art Therapy!
I make billing easy. Even though I am not in-network with any insurance, if you have out-of-network benefits associated with Aetna, Cigna, Wellfleet, United, Oxford, GHI, Cigna, Anthem / BCBS, I can bill insurance for you! You might be able to get reimbursed for out-of-network therapy! Check here: app.mentaya.com/p/5rdcML7Ayvh OR visit my website!

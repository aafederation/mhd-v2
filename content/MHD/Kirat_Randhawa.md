Kirat is a New York City based contemplative guide, therapist-in-training, and inspired student of Tibetan Buddhism. Her personal journey and deep course of study has led her to craft a pathway to guide others in personal development, conscious exploration, transformational practices, and lifeâ€™s shifts. Her training at Columbia University and The Nalanda Institute, and in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction lineage has allowed her to develop a multidimensional approach to support clients on their path toward greater alignment and joy.

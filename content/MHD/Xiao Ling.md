My standard price range for clients is $0-140 per 45min session depending on clients' insurance plans.

In addition to therapy appointments, clients will be charged $250/hr for other professional services they may need, though I will break down the hourly cost if we work for periods of less than one hour. So for each 10 minutes I charge $25, 20 minutes $50 and so on. Not covered by insurance.

Other services include report writing, telephone conversations lasting longer than 10 minutes, attendance at meetings with other professionals the clients have authorized, preparation of records or treatment summaries, and the time spent performing any other service the clients may request of me. If the client becomes involved in legal proceedings that require my participation, I charge $300 per hour for preparation and attendance at any legal proceeding because of the difficulty of legal involvement."""

I believe there’s no single approach fits in everyone’s needs. Rather, it is important to incorporate different approaches depending on the presenting problems, treatment goals, and cultural backgrounds of the individuals. I value the therapeutic alliance in treatment and approach my clients in a warm, accepting, and supportive way, with a focus upon developing corrective experience.

<br>

I am a licensed mental health counselor in New York State. I have trainings in Clinical Psychology & Child and Family Studies and received my Master’s in Mental Health Counseling from New York University. I have practiced in outpatient, private practice, and day treatment settings. Over the course of my clinical work, I have gained experience with mood dysregulation, relationship issues, work stress, and cultural & racial identity. I believe it is the therapeutic relationship itself facilitates the healing process of the individual.

<br>

I understand that seeking psychotherapy can be challenging and even intimidating for many people, but I would love to accompany you throughout the whole journey. So if you are hesitating about starting therapy, please feel free to send me an email and I would be happy to discuss more with you.

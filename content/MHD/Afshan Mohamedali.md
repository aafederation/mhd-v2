I am a New York state licensed clinical psychologist, supervisor, and doctoral professor. I work with individual adults and couples experiencing distress due to fluctuations in mood, changing life circumstances, difficult relationships, and uncertain identity. Given my own multicultural identity, I approach every patient with compassion and curiosity for their experiences, encouraging those I work with to practice the same. I find that the most successful therapy is a result of healthy collaboration, trust, and creating a safe space to do the work.

I am a board certified art psychotherapist offering in person and online therapy for Connecticut clients and online therapy for NY clients.  Through the use of art therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and verbal psychotherapy, issues involving anxiety, depression, grief, and trauma are addressed in an empathic, gentle manner.  Art therapy provides a unique way to process our experiences while DBT provides a skills based approach to managing them.

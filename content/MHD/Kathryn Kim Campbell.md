I work collaboratively with my clients to better understand and move forward in their lives, as we gain insight into current challenges and stressors. My strength is engaging clients in an empathic and supportive therapeutic alliance. I work from a non-judgmental stance to understand the perspective of my clients and draw upon their strengths. Together, we can explore your struggles in a safe and healing space, to develop inner resources and coping strategies.

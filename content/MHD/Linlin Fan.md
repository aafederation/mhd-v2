I am a Mandarin-English-speaking psychotherapist, who specializes in therapy for individuals across the lifespan. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I have functioned as a psychotherapist in two Top 3 NYC hospitals (Mount Sinai Health and NYU Langone Health ) for the past five years. I have relocated to California and worked at Kaiser Permanente as a therapist. I have had the privilege of working with people over the past 10 years.

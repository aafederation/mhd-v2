We’ve all have some type of trauma in our life, whether it be something that affected us for a couple days, or something that we cannot stop thinking about after so many years. A lot of time people underestimate the effects of trauma. Many people have a fear of reaching out for help, a fear of being judged when they voice their feelings to their loved ones. I am here to create a safe and confidential environment for you to process your emotions. <br>
Trauma has lasting affects on our physical and mental health if it’s left untreated. It’s not uncommon for people with a history of trauma to feel detached from the rest of the world, and from their loved ones. I specialize in trauma therapy, including trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), eye-movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) therapy, schema-focused therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). My goal is to help those who have experienced trauma, grow from their experience and be their better self. <br>

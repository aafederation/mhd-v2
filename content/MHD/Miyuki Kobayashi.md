Talking about your struggles with your close friends and family members can be helpful. But, often, additional support and outside perspective also can help you view those issues in a new light and gain deeper understanding of your challenges. My therapeutic work focuses on what each person wants to achieve through therapy. Some strive to reduce anxiety and lift depression. Others seek therapeutic help for non-mental issues and everyday concerns such as relationships, work, low self-esteem, and dissatisfaction in life.  
Taking the first step may require a lot of courage. But, that step can lead you to a more satisfactory life, the answers you seek and the joy you deserve. My approach can help untangle the root of your struggles in life, which usually arise from indelible memories from the past.  
Through our work together, the goal is to enhance your insight and deepen your self-knowledge. To ensure comfort and maximize progress in the therapy, I provide a safe, and confidential environment where you can talk about anything and everything that comes to mind at your own pace.

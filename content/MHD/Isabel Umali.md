Isabel Umali is an embodied therapist rooted in massage therapy and biodynamic craniosacral therapy. She brings her deep knowledge of the body, her years of high-performance professional dance experience, and her history with injury, trauma, and healing to her work. Isabel sustained two concussions in her dance work which brought her as a client, and subsequently as a practitioner, of biodynamic craniosacral therapy (BCST). This work has helped her develop acute and sensitive listening abilities, allowing her to be a present, grounded, and body-oriented practitioner. Isabel went on to complete the 1000-hr massage therapy program at Pacific College- New York. Isabel works comfortably across mediums to utilize her orthopedic, deep tissue skills along with her trauma-informed verbal and craniosacral practice. <br>
Isabel offers 60, 75 and 90 minute sessions that fluidly move between modalities. Each clientâ€™s needs are met and treatments are planned collaboratively. Injury of any kind takes time to heal, and the scars of unresolved conditions can impact us in insidious ways. Isabel effectively treats acute conditions that need relief fast with orthopedic techniques, while also working with the nervous system and more subtle aspects of the body and mind for the deeper healing at play. <br>

I am Dr. Winnie Ma (she/her/hers), a licensed psychologist in New York who is passionate about supporting immigrant and racial/ethnic minority youth and adults facing a range of issues â€“ relationships, family, career, or identity. With over two decades of experience working with culturally diverse populations in various clinical and educational settings in New York and New Jersey, I brings my knowledge and cultural understanding to my practice. My particular expertise lies in supporting immigrants and Asian American youth and adults.

Hello, I'm Shirley, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker based in NY/NJ, with a focus on the mental health of young people and working adults. Since my licensure, I have worked with clients experiencing a myriad of mental health challenges, whether they were personally and/or societally rooted. I work with clients to deepen self-reflection and understanding of intergenerational wounds. Therapy is a supportive partnership where we will explore various avenues of healing with courage, curiosity, and compassion.

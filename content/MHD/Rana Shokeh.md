Our approach to therapy is rooted in a psychodynamic, trauma-informed, anti-oppressive lens. This means we always consider the diversity of our clients’ lived experiences, relationships, and identities in order to create a safe space for communities and marginalized groups of every race, faith, gender, sexual identity, or body size.  
  
The center of the Taslim approach is experiential healing through a sincere relationship with our therapists. Relationships with clients are carefully considered and nurtured over time – allowing the therapist to appreciate the individuality and motivations of the person. You will be matched with a therapist who will always respect and acknowledge your unique experiences and identities. The goal is to help you explore your past, thoughts, and emotions to understand yourself and live a more full and satisfying life.

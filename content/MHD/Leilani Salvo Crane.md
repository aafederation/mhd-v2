Full fee is $250 per 45-minute session. I slide for clients of Asian descent--and other BIPOC--who are unable to afford the full fee.

I am a psychologist licensed in New York (NY022550) and Pennsylvania (PS016778), with a doctorate in clinical psychology from the Institute for Graduate Clinical Psychology at Widener University. I completed my postdoctoral training at the Renfrew Center of Philadelphia, a residential facility that treats adolescent girls and women struggling with eating disorders. My work is enhanced by my studies in world religions (University of Chicago Divinity School, MA) and international finance (Thunderbird School of International Management, MBA). As a multiracial/multicultural daughter of an Asian immigrant, I am passionate about matters of identity, race, culture and social justice.

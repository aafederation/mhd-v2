Dr. Lee is a proud second-generation Korean American raised in New York City. She is humbled to be the first in her family to graduate post-secondary education at Barnard College of Columbia University where she studied Neuroscience and Gender Studies. She went on to earn her doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology with specialization in Neuropsychology and Health Psychology from The Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology of Yeshiva University. Dr. Lee is a published author in peer-reviewed journals centering research on gender and racial-specific disparities in access to behavioral health impacting outcomes and neuropsychological assessment. In her role as Co-Chair of the Psychology Division’s Council for Anti-Racism and Equity (CARE), she is involved with coordination and development of various causes and initiatives, including the Women’s Mentorship Series, creating social and mentorship opportunities for BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ staff and trainees, the promotion of culturally-inclusive supervision and clinical practices, and providing education related to decolonizing practices within psychology.  
As one of the few bilingual neuropsychologists nationally, Dr. Lee provides a well-needed service of neuropsychological evaluation for Korean-speaking adults, in addition to providing services across the lifespan in English. She also provides culturally-affirming psychotherapy and neurocognitive rehabilitative intervention. She holds membership in various neuropsychology groups including the Queer Neuropsychological Society, the Hispanic Neuropsychological Society, and serves on the Asian Neuropsychological Association Education Committee where she assisted in the development continues to coordinate the Mentorship Program.

Iâ€™m a psychotherapist who works best helping goal-oriented, high-functioning clients get results through deep, exploratory work while providing tools and insights that bring about change.   
  
My practice is catered specifically to adults for individual work. I look closely at how our environment, past and present experience, and exposure to trauma impact us in the present. I believe in the relationship between the mind and body and explore this in sessions with clients. My approach is trauma-informed and utilizes both psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral therapy.  
  
I specialize in working with people on:  
Relationship concerns  
Racial and cultural identity  
Acculturation and cross-cultural concerns (intergenerational and cultural trauma)  
Anxiety  
Depression

As a licensed mental health counselor in New York, I'm committed to supporting and validating your real-life experiences while also exploring solutions that will make a difference in your life. My experience includes 6+ years in psychotherapy as well as 20+ years as a working professional within the US and in East Asia, which informs the work I do when it comes to accepting and adjusting to inevitable changes in your life. My approach is multicultural, anti-racist, and inclusive. I use evidence-based approaches such as Solution-Focused Behavioral Therapy (SFBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is active acceptance of "what is" along with a willingness and commitment to enact values-based actions to "what can be."

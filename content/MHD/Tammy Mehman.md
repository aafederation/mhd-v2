Tammy Mehman (she/her) is a licensed clinical social worker at the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center. Here, she sees young adult patients who have experienced sexual assault/intimate partner violence, while also going out into the community to provide gender-based violence prevention education to students and faculty at different colleges and community centers. When sheâ€™s not at the clinic, Tammy is a private practice psychotherapist where she sees adults with a range of mental health concerns. She is also certified as a trauma-informed yoga instructor! As a South Asian, Muslim woman- Tammy tends to hold space for intergenerational trauma and wants to debunk the ways that some communities look at mental health by taking a culturally sensitive and trauma informed approach.

I welcome all aspects of each individual with empathy and compassion. I collaborate with each client on how to best work together to identify patterns, habits, beliefs and blocks which contribute to stress and interfere with feeling fulfillment, satisfaction and joy. I offer deep listening, nuanced observations and stimulating questions such that clients open to new insights, possibilities and ways of being. I facilitate people to come home to themselves, an invitation to re-connect with intrinsic wholeness.  
  
Embracing wholeness is a journey. Some steps along the way will seem light, positive, and empowering, while others will be difficult, dark and challenging. Holding a space to welcome all is a process of building capacity and tolerance for a wider range of experiences. Approaching every behavior as having an important function, I use imagery, creativity, movement and other gentle ways to explore. As well, I utilize mindfulness to increase awareness, enrich presence and deepen embodiment.   
  
No matter what difficult events a person experiences, there is an unstoppable aliveness in every individual. I revere such life energy, which is inherently wise, whole and healing. With facilitation guided by openness and loving acceptance, my clients learn to balance stress and vitality as well as grow into greater ease, choices, meaning, purpose and aliveness.   
  
The focus of my practice is to offer body-mind integration to immigrants, descendants of immigrants, BIPOC and multiracial folx.

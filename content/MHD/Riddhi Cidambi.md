Riddhi’s Focus  
Riddhi’s areas of focus include: anxiety, depression, multicutural issues, relationships of all kinds, and how discrimination and systemic oppression impact our psychological wellbeing.

  
Riddhi’s Philosophy  
Riddhi believes in the power of therapy to help us explore parts of ourselves that we often judge or push away. By bringing them to the surface, therapy can be a space to feel compassion towards ourselves and give some meaning to how we exist in the world. Riddhi believes in the importance of a non-judgemental space and a secure therapeutic relationship, and aims to meet people where they are, understanding that the process of healing and growing through therapy is unique to each individual.

  
Riddhi’s Approach  
Riddhi’s approach is grounded in psychodynamic orientation, and she aims to apply an antioppressive, anti-racist lens to all her work.

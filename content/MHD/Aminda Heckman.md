Are you struggling with infertility? Trying to adopt? Have you already started your family but it "just doesn't feel" like you thought it would? There are a lot of excellent therapists out there, and finding the right fit is crucial. Many of my clients are often the experts in their own life but just need someone to show them where to find answers. While I have extensive experience working with clients with a wide spectrum of mental health and life adjustment issues (including depression, anxiety, and trauma), I also specialize in infertility issues, post-partum mental health, adoption home studies, and attachment challenges. <br>
I know firsthand that building a family is a roller coaster ride. From infertility to adoption to post-adoption to blended, I am here to welcome you and your families to my practice. I utilize an eclectic toolbox of therapeutic and compassionate modalities catered to you. <br>

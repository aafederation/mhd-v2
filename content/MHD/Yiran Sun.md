Yiran utilizes an eclectic approach to therapy, drawing from person-centered, cognitive behavioral, psychodynamic, mindfulness, and motivational interviewing. Yiran serves as a non-judgmental and open-minded observer, encouraging clients to reflect and gain new perspectives on themselves and the world around them. Yiranâ€™s process employs active listening, validation, and empowerment, creating a safe space for clients to process their emotions, gain self-awareness, and strengthen coping skills. <br>
Yiran has experience working with a variety of clients, from children to seniors in both private agencies and community clinics. She has previously worked extensively with first-generation immigrants, minority populations, and their families to offer linguistically sensitive therapies. She works collaboratively with clients and addresses issues like anxiety, depression, trauma, perfectionism, career, self-identity, life transitions, relationships, and self-growth. <br>

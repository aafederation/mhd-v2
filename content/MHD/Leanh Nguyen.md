I have dedicated my practice to the care of immigrants, trauma survivors, and Asian-Americans over the past 25 years. Trained in psychoanalysis and with extensive experience in trauma, I also bring to the work a life coaching orientation â€”an effective combination of working through and looking forward, of healing and growth, of insight and change.

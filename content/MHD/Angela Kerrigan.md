I help adults overcome perfectionism, OCD, and other anxiety related disorders. Whether you're living with intrusive thoughts or compulsive behaviors that make you feel stuck, therapy is a great place to start getting your life back. I approach therapy with evidence-based methods as well as a deep understanding of the intersection at which cultural & racial identity meets mental health.

Growing up if I ever was feeling under the weather, my mother would first tell me to take a few drops of a bitter, disgusting tincture, but I would get better. If I had an upset stomach I would lie down and she would massage my back and I would feel better. As I got older nasal congestion was flushed out with a nasal cleansing pot instead of chemical nasal sprays. Muscle aches were treated with stretches and self massages, instead of pills. From a young age I was taught that health was more than drugs and surgery.

Fast forward a couple of years. I co-founded three yoga studios and was teaching weekly yoga classes, seeing hundreds of students. Although they would feel better after class I would see the same students come in with the same issue week after week. I thought that there must be something more that I can do.

When all of the typical approaches don’t work; the MRI only shows slight inflammation, painkillers are prescribed, physical therapy just isn't helping and many people don’t know what else to do. That’s where acupuncture and Chinese Medicine comes in. I have helped multiple patients who initially come in struggling with pain. The difference is working with YOU, the person, your body, your relationships, your lifestyle and history. THIS is what truly excites me about what I do. I get to make a difference in people’s lives, oftentimes when they have run out of options. I get to help people take back their lives and bring relief from pain and suffering.

I believe that a patient centered approach is essential in providing quality health care. I take the time to connect and learn about my patients, their lifestyle, backgrounds as well as medical history that may seem unrelated and unimportant in conventional methods.  My approach is not dictated by symptoms, prescriptions or surgery.  I strive to empower my patients, to remind our bodies of the amazing natural ability to heal. If you are looking for another way, if conventional medicine is just not working out, contact me and let’s see how together we can work towards balance, health and wellbeing.

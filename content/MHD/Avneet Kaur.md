Our lives are full of relationships, some with ourselves and some with other peopleâ€¦there are times when these relationships appear to not work as well as we may like. It could just be not feeling good about yourself or issues with family, friends, or a significant other. I believe that it is always necessary to work on all these relationships as well as your mental health constantly. My work is to help individuals improve all the relationships in their lives through the means of healthy communication. <br>
I am a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in NYS & received my Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy from Hofstra University. As an Indian American, I am fluent in English, Punjabi, Hindi, and Urdu. <br>

I work with adults and couples who feel a lack of connection with themselves and are seeking a sense of belonging by providing trauma-informed radical acceptance, increasing mind-body-spirit connection, and collaboratively creating safety and liberation from the mindsets, institutions, and systems that prevent you from thriving.  
  
In each interaction I seek to be anti: racist, sexist, fatphobic, transphobic, ableist, and capitalist to unlearn and reconnect the pieces of ourselves that weâ€™ve had to utilize or forgo in order to survive - to get each person to a place where they can thrive. Together, we explore what makes you authentically you and work to bolster your unique strengths.

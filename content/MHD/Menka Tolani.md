I utilize a strengths-based approach to help my clients recognize the skills and abilities they already possess, starting with showing up to therapy and wanting to make changes in their life. I use a holistic approach to understand and address the ways issues in one aspect of my client’s life can lead to concerns in other areas. I apply evidence-based modalities such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Solution Based Therapy, and Mindfulness Therapy, depending on the individual’s needs. I come from an international background, which assists me in working with individuals, couples, and families from different backgrounds and religions as well. My experience includes providing individual therapy to children, adolescents, and adults from all types of backgrounds who struggle with anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and grief.

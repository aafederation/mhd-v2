I have been a clinical social worker in the mental health field for more than 15 years. I am certified in EMDR and also utilize strategies from multiple perspectives including mindfulness and CBT. I have extensive experience with veterans and individuals who have experienced emotional, physical, and sexual abuse/assault. I am constantly seeking out and participating in trainings and conversations on social justice issues. I strive to offer honest, straightforward conversations in a relaxed environment. I am committed to offering and fostering a supportive environment that allows for individuals to live and thrive in authentic and genuine ways. My ongoing goal is to challenge my own assumptions, privileges, and prejudices in order to grow and learn. I strive to offer engaging and thoughtful dialogues to assist others with doing the same.  
  
As a first generation bi racial Korean American, I have my own experience of exploring and gaining confidence in my identity. I feel privileged to work with others who are coping with identity exploration as well as racial trauma.   
  
I also have a long history of working with the LGBTQI+ community and am able to assist individuals who are exploring their sexual orientations and/or gender identities.

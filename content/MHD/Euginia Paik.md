I believe that the wish to understand oneself takes a lot of courage. I feel honored to join patients as they embark on a journey of self-exploration. I have a range of interests in addressing "problems of living", such as: life transitions, work and career, formulating and prioritizing life goals, anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties, problems with intimacy, and loss of a loved one. Humor, curiosity, and back and forth dialogue are part of my therapeutic style. I partner as a co-pilot, to guide and support in the exploration of motivational and emotional patterns.

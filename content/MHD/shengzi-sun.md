Shengzi believes everyone has the potential to achieve their life goals. She views therapy as a journey where people can explore their inner world, realizing their innate power, and then become their true selves, able to live a life they love. In this journey, clients and therapists are companions, working together to address and unpack those things in the past and present that inhibit the realization of the client’s ideal future. Primary therapeutic modalities include Person-Centered Counseling, psychodynamic theory, DBT, CBT, Narrative Therapy, Existential theories, and other relational approaches.  
  
Shengzi has clinical experiences working with individuals and couples with various mental health concerns such as Anxiety, Depression, primary family issues, trauma, transition & adjustment difficulties, and various substance-misuse related issues. She is especially passionate about working with clients from culturally diverse backgrounds, and providing linguistically sensitive, culturally appropriate, and multicultural focused treatments tailored to clients’ backgrounds and presenting concerns.  
  
Shengzi says:" It’s about you. And, it’s about you realizing you have it all within you."

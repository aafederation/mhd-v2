I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who graduated from NYU with a Masterâ€™s degree in social work. I have nine years of experience working in community-based mental health as well as substance use treatment. This means that treatment is more than just mental health or substance use but also grounds the therapy in your community, relationships, and other circumstances that make your situation unique. My approach to therapy can help make positive change in your life with treatment is empathetic, inclusive, and analytically informed. I work from a non-judgmental stance since I understand how difficult it can be to express vulnerabilities to another. I have extensive experience working in harm reduction as well as helping those who struggle with issues related to trauma, interpersonal issues related to family, race, personality disorders, and other behavioral health issues.

I am a South Asian Licensed Clinical Social Worker that focuses on various issues including Depression, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, Relationships, Self-esteem, Grief, and Bereavement. <br>
My sessions are client-centered and use various modalities including CBT, Motivational Interviewing, and Mindfulness. <br>
My background includes working with women, children and families. I focus on a strengths-based approach which allows individuals to utilize their own strengths in order to overcome issues and challenges they may face in their lives. <br>
There is no ‘perfect person’ for this type of therapy. Anyone dealing with any type of behavioral or emotional issues, from depression to couple’s counseling, and everything in between, is welcome. <br>
You can rest assured that you will be in a comfortable, supportive, and encouraging environment, where the focus will be on you alone and your individual needs to achieve growth are the top priority. <br>

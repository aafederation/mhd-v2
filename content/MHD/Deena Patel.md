Reaching out for help shows personal strength and the courage to change. A therapist who understands you can help guide you toward a feeling of inner resilience. I specialize in treating trauma, emotional suffering, relationship issues, and psychological stress. I provide care that meets your individual needs to empower you as you explore, process change, and learn to be present with what is. <br>
I am a practiced EMDR, IFC, and Somatic therapist and use these treatments to successfully treat single-incident trauma, complex trauma, phobias, and anxiety producing/distressing future events. I help you address somatic issues, attachment injuries, past pain experienced in relationships, and addiction. <br>
I incorporate techniques found in behavioral and mindfulness, CBT, IFC, DBT, Somatic, and recovery-oriented therapies to support your healing. I offer EMDR intensives (4hrs+) & telehealth services. I look forward to helping you start your journey. "No one is wise by birth, for wisdom results from one ownâ€™s efforts" - Krishnamacharya <br>

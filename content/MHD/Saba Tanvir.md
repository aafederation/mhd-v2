Choosing the right therapist can be difficult, confusing and perhaps overwhelming. I have an engaging, compassionate and easy-going style that helps my clients feel comfortable. In my practice, I utilize strength based approaches in conjunction with Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Motivational Interviewing and Psychodynamic Therapy. <br>
I specialize in working with children, teens and adults who are enduring anxiety, depression, OCD and/or have a history of trauma. I have over 10 years of experience in the behavioral health field. I am highly trained especially in regards to Trauma Informed Care and Crisis Management. <br>
I believe therapy is a collaborative effort. In working together, I can help you manage your condition and assist you in improving your overall quality of life.

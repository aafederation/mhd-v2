I specialize in working with adults and young adults experiencing anxiety, relationship difficulties, or feeling the impact of stressful experiences, including family or childhood trauma, in their daily lives. I also provide couples therapy for partners struggling with communication, life transitions, and other stressors. My goal is to guide and help people work through their difficult experiences and gain the insight and skills needed to overcome symptoms undermining their ability to build the life and relationships they want. I frequently focus on past and present relationships when working with individuals and I integrate historical understanding and solution-focused interventions with couples. My style is warm, gentle, and honest, with appropriate humor.

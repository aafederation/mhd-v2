Hi there! My name is Alyssa Vu and my pronouns are she/her/hers. My priority is to provide a space where my clients feel comfortable and safe to express themselves truthfully while empowering them with strategies, skills, and strengths to overcome their challenges. I want to learn how my clients perceive themselves and how their sense of self is played out in their lives. With empathy and understanding, I strive to provide treatments that consider my clientsâ€™ backgrounds, behaviors, and thought processes through a medley of tailored approaches. I work with clients who experience depression, anxiety, identity complexities, familial and relationship issues, life transitions, cultural challenges, and trauma. I welcome clients who bring in different challenges and experiences, as I am confident that we will learn to face them together. <br>
When you are ready to talk, feel free to contact me for a free 15-minute consultation to begin. Looking forward to working with you <br>

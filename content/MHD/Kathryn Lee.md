Do you cognitively know one thing and yet feel another? Not sure why you struggle to express your emotions? You are not alone. I work collaboratively with individuals on various issues to make sense of their thoughts and feelings, break patterns and cycles, and ultimately lead more fulfilling, healthy lives. Therapy is a process of cultivating awareness, unlearning, and relearning; I work with clients to get to the "root" of your issues to create long lasting change. With gentle curiosity and empathy, we will learn what it is that you need to be your most authentic self and foster a healthy relationship with yourself and others.  
  
As a therapist, I work relationally with a trauma focused, emotion focused and attachment based lens. My style is to be exploratory and practical, while also creating an empathic, non judgmental, compassionate environment. When appropriate I will gently nudge and challenge you to expand your ideas and shed some insight.  
  
Research has shown that finding the right therapist for you is one of the most important factors for your growth and healing. Feel free to reach out for a free consultation, where we can chat about what brings you to therapy and see if we are a good fit. I'm excited to potentially work with you.

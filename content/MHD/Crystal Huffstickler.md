Great to meet you!
I am a licensed clinical social worker with a background in education and social justice. I specialize in working through identity issues, anxiety, depression, trauma, stress management, life transitions, and more. I am passionate about working with older adults, BIPOC identifying adults, and LGBTQIA+ identifying adults.

A bit about my approach to therapy
My style is very engaging and interactive. I partner with clients to explore their inner workings and self-concept, set goals, and cultivate the skills to achieve those goals. I bring a warm and compassionate presence to sessions. I help clients feel empowered to change their lives for the better.

What you can expect from our first session
Clients will feel heard, valued, and affirmed in our sessions. They will walk away with new insights, increased self understanding, and the skills necessary to meet their goals.

Hello lovely people, I am Sharon, a licensed bilingual psychotherapist with over six years of experience in counseling with bicultural pediatric and adult populations. <br>
Life is short and how can we live the best of it? How can you manage work stress and social anxiety? Do you often doubt yourself, feel lonely or sad, and can’t find purpose in life? I believe psychotherapy is not only about curing or resolving pain, but also increasing awareness, understanding, and accepting the full range of human emotion. It’s important to feel the different emotions and learn how to express ourselves fully. I am specialized in the treatment of mood disorders, intimacy, self-esteem, trauma, relationship issues, and self-exploration. <br>
I integrate a culturally-sensitive approach, especially when working with Asian/Asian-American and other BIPOC individuals. I grew up in China and I am fluent in both English and Mandarin. I use individualized psychodynamic and evidence-based treatment and always work to meet you where you are. Together, we will start a journey to explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences; reflect on your past; and connect the dots to live your life to the fullest. <br>
The beauty of our work is finding your strengths and having an “aha moment” during our positive therapeutic process. I welcome you to explore your authentic self, and work towards becoming your BEST self. <br>

My therapy style is informed by Eclectic Psychotherapy (EP), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Brainspotting, Rational Emotive Behavioral (REBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) & the Gottman Method. I specialize in complex trauma and unconventional lifestyles. <br>
I am a mid-transition non-binary therapist who believes in the “activism cure” for returning power, peace, and agency to those who had it abruptly taken from them… by creating meaning, purpose, and beauty from all that still remains. We will search for creative methods of integration — understanding perplexing events through clearing our lens together or figuring out which perspective and narrative gives you the most clarity, without the burden of unnecessary labels from society dictating what your identity should be at the expense of who you really are. <br>
